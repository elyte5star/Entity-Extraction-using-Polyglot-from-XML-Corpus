        <p>The Onex Corporation, Canada's largest investment firm, has joined the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board in its bid for Bell Canada, the country's largest telephone company. Onex will bring additional capital to the bid and help ensure that the pension fund's bid meets Canadian ownership requirements for telecommunications companies. Others in the bidding group include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, that province's biggest pension fund. Bell, which changed its name from BCE last week, has formally recognized two other bidding groups, one led by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Bell's largest stockholder with 6.3 percent of its shares, and the other led by Cerberus Capital Management working with unnamed Canadian investors.</p>
