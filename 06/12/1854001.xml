        <p>Google says it will soon begin testing a long-awaited system that can block unauthorized copyrighted clips from being uploaded to YouTube, the popular video-sharing site it bought last year.</p>
        <p>Company executives have predicted that the technology, once deployed, would lead to a détente with the studios and television networks that have bitterly complained about the proliferation of their copyrighted clips on YouTube.</p>
        <p>YouTube said it would initially test the technology, called video fingerprinting, with a group of partners, including Disney and Time Warner, and planned to make it available more widely in the next few months. ''We hope to have a better understanding of how this is going to work, not just from a technology standpoint, but also from a policy standpoint,'' said Chris Maxcy, vice president for business development at YouTube. ''The goal is to have something more openly available for content owners broadly later this year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxcy said the technology, which was developed by Google, would be tested for accuracy and speed.</p>
        <p>A Google spokesman said it had invited several companies, including some that do not have licensing deals with YouTube, to test the system.</p>
