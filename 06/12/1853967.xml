        <p>Richard C. Notebaert, who is credited with bringing Qwest Communications back from an accounting scandal and the brink of bankruptcy, surprised investors yesterday by announcing that he planned to resign as chief executive and chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Notebaert, who took the helm of Qwest in 2002 when it faced difficult legal and competitive challenges, said that he would leave to spend more time with his family and to focus on other interests. The company said that he would stay until a successor was named.</p>
        <p>The announcement surprised industry analysts, who have given Mr. Notebaert credit for steering Qwest, the smallest of the regional telephone companies, back to stability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Notebaert's resignation follows closely the resignations of two other top Qwest executives: Oren G. Shaffer, chief financial officer, who left April 1, and Barry Allen, chief operations officer, who announced his retirement this month.</p>
        <p>The departure of the key executives ''suggests turmoil is coming,'' said Donna Jaegers, an industry analyst with Janco Partners, who has a sell rating on the stock. Qwest's shares closed at $9.36, down nearly 8 percent. In the last few years, the shares have risen steadily, from less than $4 three years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Notebaert and his team deserve credit for cutting Qwest's costs and bringing it order, Ms. Jaegers said, but the company still faces major strategic challenges. In particular, she said, Qwest must find a way to compete more effectively in the long-distance phone and data market outside of its core 14-state market.</p>
        <p>Bob Toevs, a spokesman for Qwest, which is based in Denver, said the company has replacements already for Mr. Allen and Mr. Shaffer and that it is well equipped to deal with a transition. ''We've got a talented bench and strong senior management,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Notebaert replaced Joseph P. Nacchio as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Nacchio was convicted in April of insider trading. Under Mr. Notebaert, Qwest made an aggressive attempt in 2005 to become a bigger player in the long-distance corporate market by bidding to buy MCI. But Qwest was ultimately outbid by a rival, Verizon Communications.</p>
        <p>The company also has put enormous emphasis on customer service, which Mr. Notebaert constantly stresses, and has turned around some of the poor customer reviews that once burdened it. The company also has largely put behind it the fallout from an accounting scandal that forced it to restate earnings for 2000 and 2001, when it had understated losses by $2.54 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Notebaert said in a conference call with investors yesterday that he was proud of the last five years and that he felt the team of executives had re-established Qwest's ''integrity, liquidity and profitability.''</p>
        <p>Now, he said, ''profitability is a consistent thing for us.''</p>
