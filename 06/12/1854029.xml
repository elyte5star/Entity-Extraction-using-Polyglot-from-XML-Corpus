        <p>The Canadian real estate investor Brookfield Asset Management made a cash offer worth 4.2 billion Australian dollars ($3.55 billion) for Multiplex, a troubled Australian developer and contractor. The directors of Multiplex, which was sued over repeated delays in the construction of the new Wembley Stadium in London, have approved the offer. It is subject to approval by 51 percent of shareholders. For Brookfield, based in Toronto, the chief attraction is Multiplex's real estate, valued at about $7.6 billion, rather than its construction operations. ''This is a company that has assets similar to ours: high-quality office buildings in central business districts,'' said Jeff Blidner, a managing partner at Brookfield. ''They have an approach to their portfolio that's very similar to ours.''</p>
