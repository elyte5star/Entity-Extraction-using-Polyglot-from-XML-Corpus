      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Two members of Congress have asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate what they called the H.I.V./AIDS crisis in Puerto Rico and the federal oversight of money provided for care of indigent AIDS patients there. In a letter to Comptroller General David M. Walker, the two lawmakers, Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, Democrat of New York, and Representative Hilda L. Solis, Democrat of California, cited testimony from community and patient groups in Puerto Rico and recent news accounts indicating that the Puerto Rican authorities have mismanaged federal money meant for groups helping AIDS patients, and that many patients have endured waits for lifesaving drug therapies. The letter called on the G.A.O. to scrutinize actions taken by the Health Resources and Services Administration, the federal agency that dispenses money under the Ryan White Care Act, to ensure that that money is better spent. Some $53 million went to Puerto Rico last year.</p>
