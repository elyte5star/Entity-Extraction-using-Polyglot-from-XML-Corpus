        <p>Afghan security forces found a sophisticated roadside bomb of the type used in Iraq in the center of Kabul last month, the first time such a device has been discovered in the capital, an Afghan intelligence official said Monday. The bomb was primed to hit a convoy of high-ranking Afghan officials or international forces, the official said.</p>
        <p>A NATO spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Maria Carl, confirmed that the type of bomb, called an explosively formed penetrator, or E.F.P., was found in Kabul in May.</p>
        <p>The bomb contained 16 kilograms, or about 35 pounds, of explosives and was set to be detonated by remote control from up to a kilometer, the intelligence official said. He asked not to be identified by name because of the secret nature of his job.</p>
        <p>The bomb was found in the western part of Kabul, near Polytechnic University, he said.</p>
        <p>The Afghan official declined to comment on the origin of the bomb or on when exactly it had been found. Roadside bombs of the E.F.P. type have been frequently used in Iraq, and military officials there have said the sophisticated bombs have their origin in neighboring Iran.</p>
        <p>The use of roadside bombs has increased in Afghanistan in the past 18 months, but most have been made from remote-controlled antitank mines laid under or beside the road.</p>
        <p>Colonel Carl said that the Kabul bomb was the second such bomb found in Afghanistan, and that it was a little more sophisticated than the first, which was found in April in western Afghanistan, a region that borders Iran.</p>
        <p>The bomb had similar characteristics to those found in Iraq, but its origin was not clear, she said. ''Obviously we are very interested in finding more about where it came from just so we can prevent more of them in the future,'' she said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere on Monday, a suicide bomber's car struck a police checkpoint outside the provincial town of Khost in eastern Afghanistan, wounding three policemen, one critically, and eight civilians.</p>
        <p>The car bomb exploded almost two miles outside Khost as the police were checking cars entering the town. It set off a huge fire, and most of the victims were injured from the spreading flames, the provincial governor, Arsallah Jamal, said after visiting the town hospital.</p>
        <p>''One of the policemen already lost his leg, and probably he will lose the other leg and is in a very critical condition,'' Mr. Jamal said.</p>
