        <p>Young children work hard to understand their environment, and the goal of education is to enable that process. Many teachers already know the value of occupational therapy as a tool to help children grow in skill and confidence. The more enlightened schools have therapists on staff or available for consultations. This issue belongs with the American Academy of Pediatrics, since sensory problems in a healthy child are more properly regarded as issues of growth and maturity.</p>
