        <p>My business travel is fairly uneventful. But a flight this year did force me onto a slippery slope of morality.</p>
        <p>As I was waiting to board my flight from O'Hare, I saw a departing passenger in an animated discussion with a gate agent. He was clutching a coat and looked as if he just wouldn't let go of it. It seemed that he had taken the wrong coat and he was being questioned. He walked away from the agent, who pursued him. A terse discussion ensued, ending with the man's departure sans coat. I kept thinking how miserable this guy was going to be without a coat since it was so cold outside.</p>

        <p>My business travel is fairly uneventful. But a flight this year did force me onto a slippery slope of morality.</p>
        <p>As I was waiting to board my flight from O'Hare, I saw a departing passenger in an animated discussion with a gate agent. He was clutching a coat and looked as if he just wouldn't let go of it. It seemed that he had taken the wrong coat and he was being questioned. He walked away from the agent, who pursued him. A terse discussion ensued, ending with the man's departure sans coat. I kept thinking how miserable this guy was going to be without a coat since it was so cold outside.</p>
        <p>I finally got on the plane, and I realized that I would have barely enough time to make my connection if all went well. Unfortunately, we had to circle the Detroit airport for about 20 minutes. And the descent was excruciatingly slow. If I missed the connecting flight to Charlottesville, I would probably be stuck in Detroit until the next day.</p>
        <p>Through a process of firm but polite pushing, I managed to be among the first passengers off the plane. Clutching my 20-pound vintage laptop bag, carry-on and brown suede jacket, I dashed out the jetway so I could make it to my departure gate. As I was waiting for the shuttle, I put my hands in my coat pocket to find my lip balm. Instead, I found a pack of gum. I don't chew gum. And then I realized I took someone else's coat.</p>
        <p>The odds of the same thing happening to me as what happened to the guy back in Chicago are astronomical. I couldn't believe it. I figured I would at least try to get back on the plane I just left to see if I could find my coat and return the coat I was wearing -- which, by the way, looked remarkably like mine but was in much better condition.</p>
        <p>I talked my way back on the plane as people were de-boarding. No coat. I didn't even mention my dilemma to the gate agent. It was freezing and I needed a coat. I figured I would deal with the fallout later.</p>
        <p>I found a boarding pass nestled in one of the coat pockets and the pass had the passenger's name. So once home, I got on the airline's site and, using the name and ticket number, found the passenger's itinerary. The point of origin was Erie, Pa. I located a company in Erie that had an employee with the same name. A few more clicks and I had his phone number.</p>
        <p>So I called him and told him I had his coat. He said, ''You mean the one from the plane last night?'' After a long pause, he came back and said, ''I wondered why I had trouble getting my arms through the sleeves.''</p>
        <p>We agreed to do a coat swap. But then I remembered I was taking a trip to New York in a few days and wouldn't get my coat back in time. So I asked him if he minded if I wore his coat for a week. He said no problem. I did finally return his coat and his pack of gum. And he gave me back my ratty coat and my lip balm. I guess we both made out O.K. But I sure did like that coat.</p>
