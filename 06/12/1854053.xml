        <p>Mayor John DeStefano Jr. asked the federal government yesterday to ''back off'' from any further raids on illegal immigrants until allegations that agents broke rules in conducting one such raid last Wednesday could be addressed. The mayor said yesterday that another raid was ''imminent.'' At the same time, three Connecticut lawmakers -- Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman and Representative Rosa L. DeLauro -- wrote to Michael Chertoff, left, the homeland security secretary, seeking answers to questions about procedures used during the raid. The lawmakers also asked whether the timing of the raid was tied to a decision by city officials to provide identification cards to all residents, including illegal immigrants.</p>
