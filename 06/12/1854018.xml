        <p>The top American military commander for the Middle East has warned Iraq's prime minister in a closed-door conversation that the Iraqi government needs to make tangible political progress by next month to counter the growing tide of opposition to the war in Congress.</p>
        <p>In a Sunday afternoon discussion that mixed gentle coaxing with a sober appraisal of politics in Baghdad and Washington, the commander, Adm. William J. Fallon, told Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that the Iraqi government should aim to complete a law on the division of oil proceeds by next month.</p>
        <p>Iraq's Shiite dominated-government, Admiral Fallon added in the meeting, has consolidated power and should have the confidence to reach out to its opponents. ''You have the power,'' Admiral Fallon said. ''You should take the initiative.''</p>
        <p>The admiral's appeal, which was made in the presence of Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Iraq, a senior political adviser to the command and this reporter, elicited an assurance from Mr. Maliki that he hoped to make some progress over the coming weeks. But he also offered a lengthy account of all the tribulations facing the Iraqi government, including tenuous security, distrustful neighboring Sunni states and a complex legal agenda.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of difficulties that are not well understood from outside,'' Mr. Maliki said. ''Still, we're trying hard.''</p>
        <p>Admiral Fallon, who is in charge of the United States Central Command, used a whirlwind trip to Iraq to reinforce Washington's public and private message that political progress was lagging. It is a message that has been delivered by several other American officials, but the deadlines have often been allowed to slip. This reporter, who is accompanying Admiral Fallon on his trip to Iraq, was allowed into the meeting. It was only at the end of the meeting that American officials agreed that it could be on the record.</p>
        <p>At times, the two sides appeared to be operating on two different clocks. While Admiral Fallon emphasized the urgency of demonstrating results, Mr. Maliki cast the political process as a long journey from dictatorship to democracy. ''The end result will be marked in history,'' said Mr. Maliki, who was flanked by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, his national security adviser, and two other aides.</p>
        <p>When President Bush decided in January to increase American troop levels in Iraq, the purpose was not to win a military victory but to improve security so the Iraqi leaders could carry out a program of political reconciliation. But now that the troops are in place, the Iraqis have little to show by way of political progress.</p>
        <p>In some ways, this summer does not seem like an auspicious period for a political breakthrough. Some Maliki aides fear that Sunni members of the government are conspiring against them with the support of Sunni Arab states. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, an important Shiite group, is being treated for lung cancer. Kurdish leaders seem preoccupied by Turkish threats to intervene militarily in northern Iraq.</p>
        <p>Iraqis are aware that the Bush administration has promised to report to Congress in September on what its new Iraq strategy has accomplished. Indeed, the Bush administration is obliged by Congressional legislation to issue an interim report in July on Iraq developments.</p>
        <p>In the meeting, Admiral Fallon focused on Iraq's oil law, assuming it was closest to completion. ''Is it reasonable to expect it to be completed in July?'' he asked. ''We have to show some progress in July for the upcoming report.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maliki said that the Kurds had raised concerns about revenue sharing arrangements, but he indicated that some progress on the oil law would be made. Ambassador Crocker pointed out that it was important that progress include the resolution of that thorny issue.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Maliki wondered aloud whether Congress would really give the Iraqis credit for tackling tough issues if they completed the oil law. Admiral Fallon reassured him that most Americans wanted the Iraqi government to succeed.</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Maliki asserted that there was already some good news to report. ''The September report should list the accomplishments,'' he said. ''There are lots of positive developments. Our spirit is not broken. Another success is that no one is above the law.''</p>
        <p>Admiral Fallon brought up the question of Iraq's security forces. Fielding an army and police force was not just a matter of training troops and providing equipment, he said. Iraqis had to be confident that some units were not carrying out a sectarian agenda, a major problem over the past year. Mr. Maliki agreed with him that troops driven by sectarian passions were a threat.</p>
        <p>The Iraqi prime minister has often indicated that he shares many of Washington's goals, leaving American officials to wonder if some of the lack of progress reflects a lack of follow-through by lower-ranking officials, the inherent difficulties of managing the country with a government under siege or a hidden agenda.</p>
        <p>The meeting also touched on Iraq's neighbors. The American military has charged that Iran is providing arms to militant groups in Iraq, including advanced roadside bombs that have caused a disproportionate number of American casualties, and Admiral Fallon asked the Iraqis to press Iran to cut off such deliveries. The instability the Iranian arms shipments are fueling, Admiral Fallon said, is diverting American forces from vital security tasks.</p>
        <p>That prompted Mr. Maliki to ask what the Americans were doing to persuade Syria to stop the flow of foreign fighters, which have included suicide bombers, across the border. Ambassador Crocker said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had raised the matter with her Syrian counterpart. But so far there has been no resolution.</p>
        <p>''We need the cooperation of Iran and Syria,'' Mr. Maliki said. Sunni Arab states, he added, needed to be reassured that a Shiite-dominated Iraq would not be a threat. ''We won't allow the Iranians in,'' he said. ''Nor will we allow it to become a safe haven for terrorists.''</p>
        <p>Waxing philosophical, Mr. Maliki suggested that building trust with Iraq's neighbors would not be easy. ''There are two mentalities in this region,'' he said. ''Conspiracy and mistrust.''</p>
