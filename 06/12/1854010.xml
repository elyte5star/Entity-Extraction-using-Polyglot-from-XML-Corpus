        <p>The rapper, Rayquan Elliot, who performed under the name Stack Bundles, had spent the night out with friends at Stereo, a Manhattan nightclub, and stopped off at a White Castle on the way home to his building, at 14-60 Beach Channel Drive, according to relatives and acquaintances.

        <p>A 24-year-old Queens rapper whose career appeared to be on the rise was fatally shot as he was heading into his apartment building at 5 a.m. yesterday in Far Rockaway, the police said.</p>
        <p>The rapper, Rayquan Elliot, who performed under the name Stack Bundles, had spent the night out with friends at Stereo, a Manhattan nightclub, and stopped off at a White Castle on the way home to his building, at 14-60 Beach Channel Drive, according to relatives and acquaintances. As he entered his building, the police said, he was approached by an unknown number of assailants and shot in his head and neck. The assailants fled, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said late yesterday that there had been no arrests, and the case remained under investigation.</p>
        <p>''He was just getting big,'' said Davida Wooten, Mr. Elliot's aunt. She added that he had recently asked her to help him find another place to live because he felt threatened by residents at his public housing complex who were jealous of his show business success. ''He said they was hating on him, but he didn't get out fast enough,'' Ms. Wooten said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Elliot, acquaintances said, had long adopted the nickname Stacks as a reference to stacks of money and had been a familiar figure in the New York hip-hop scene as a D.J. and composer of rap lyrics. He had also performed with the artists Fabolous, D.J. Clue and Max B., and had gotten his biggest break about a year ago when he joined the group Byrd Gang, headed by Jim Jones.</p>
        <p>But as his success grew, he had remained in Far Rockaway, living alone in a second-floor apartment. He had a large entourage, and the 2006 Porsche Boxster convertible that he drove only heightened his profile among his peers in the housing project.</p>
        <p>''It's, like, jealousy,'' said Lenay Jamison, a neighbor, who said she heard shots fired outside the building at 5 a.m. and someone screaming ''call the cops.'' But she said she did not see the assailants. Mr. Elliot was declared dead about 20 minutes later at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wooten, a home health aide who works in Bayside, said that Mr. Elliot ''had a posse'' and that ''if he stood around they would all surround him and want to shake his hand.''</p>
        <p>But she said there had been menacing signs. His Porsche, she said, was vandalized last month.</p>
        <p>''Why are you hanging out with these guys who are not your friends?'' Ms. Wooten said she had asked Mr. Elliot. She said he told her, ''Auntie, it is better to keep your enemies close.''</p>
        <p>According to relatives and acquaintances, Mr. Elliot had attended La Guardia Community College for about 18 months and studied music and art. His mother is an accomplished rapper who uses the stage name Classy E, they said, and his father, who also uses the nickname Stacks, is incarcerated on a drug conviction in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a small memorial was set up outside Mr. Elliot's building and included candles, copies of CDs he had performed on and the White Castle bag he had been carrying when he was killed.</p>
