The suits -- one filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, two in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and one in State Supreme Court in Queens -- accuse the companies of breach of contract and violations of minimum-wage laws at construction sites, including a veterans hospital in Northport and a residential building in the Bronx.</p>
