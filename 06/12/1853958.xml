        <p>Rebuffing pressure from the Democratic National Committee, the Florida Democratic Party decided on Monday to make the results of the presidential primary on Jan. 29 binding.</p>
        <p>The new date, set last month by the Republican-controlled State Legislature, puts the Florida primary ahead of contests in all but four other states. It also violates the national parties' rules, which bar all but a few states from holding primaries before Feb. 5.</p>

        <p>Rebuffing pressure from the Democratic National Committee, the Florida Democratic Party decided on Monday to make the results of the presidential primary on Jan. 29 binding.</p>
        <p>The new date, set last month by the Republican-controlled State Legislature, puts the Florida primary ahead of contests in all but four other states. It also violates the national parties' rules, which bar all but a few states from holding primaries before Feb. 5.</p>
        <p>Both parties say they will strip Florida of half its delegates to their nominating conventions. Democrats say they will go further, withholding Florida delegates from any candidate who campaigns in the state.</p>
        <p>Florida Democrats had considered making the primary results nonbinding and holding caucuses like Iowa's after Feb. 5, to apportion delegates. But Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said Monday that the party did not want to anger voters by appearing to disenfranchise them.</p>
        <p>''Florida has been in a situation in the past where votes have been taken away from the people,'' Mr. Nelson said in conference call with reporters, referring to the 2000 presidential recount.</p>
        <p>He added that the party did ''not want to be in a position where the perception is that it's taking away people's right to vote.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic National Committee repeated in a statement that it would ''enforce the rules,'' adding that it would not comment further until Florida Democrats formally submitted their plan. Mr. Nelson said that he had spoken to Howard Dean, the national party chairman, about the decision and that Mr. Dean was not happy.</p>
        <p>''He was pretty hard over about not liking this whatsoever,'' Mr. Nelson said, later adding, ''This thing could be a total mess.''</p>
        <p>The party will submit its delegate selection plan in the summer, and the national rules committee is to decide on accepting it in late August.</p>
        <p>The chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, Karen Thurman, said it would be ''another form of disenfranchisement'' for the national committee to ''dilute the strength of the Florida delegation'' with sanctions.</p>
