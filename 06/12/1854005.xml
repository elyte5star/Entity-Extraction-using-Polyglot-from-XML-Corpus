        <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has picked up the endorsement of Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of the most influential Democrats in his state and a prominent Hispanic member of Congress, aides to both lawmakers said on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez's endorsement, which the aides said was to be announced on Tuesday, comes as Mrs. Clinton and her rivals for the nomination are aggressively courting Hispanic voters.</p>
        <p>Those voters are likely to play a more important role in nominating a candidate in the next presidential election because several states with large Hispanic populations, including New Jersey, have moved their primaries or caucuses to early 2008.</p>
        <p>In previous presidential elections, states like Iowa and New Hampshire, with relatively small numbers of Hispanic voters, were essentially alone among states involved in the early nominating process.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton scored a major victory several weeks ago, when she received the endorsement of another prominent Hispanic official, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles. Mr. Villaraigosa is also one of the most powerful Democrats in California, which has moved its primary to Feb. 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez's decision to endorse Mrs. Clinton was confirmed by aides to both senators who said they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's main rival, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, had reached out to Mr. Menendez in recent weeks in an apparent effort to win his support, according to one person close to Mr. Menendez.</p>
        <p>The endorsement by Mr. Menendez, a Cuban-American raised in Union City, N.J., will help Mrs. Clinton solidify her standing in New Jersey, where Gov. Jon S. Corzine has already announced his support for her candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez has developed a close working relationship with Mrs. Clinton, largely as a result of their efforts to secure recovery aid for New York and New Jersey after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>More recently, the two worked together to eliminate a provision in an immigration bill that would have made it harder for legal immigrants in the United States to bring over spouses or children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez, a prodigious fund-raiser who has been named a national co-chairman of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, also intends to help her raise money, including soliciting donations from wealthy Cuban donors in Miami who have supported his candidacies, according to people in both camps.</p>
        <p>He also plans to extend his campaign efforts for Mrs. Clinton to the rest of Florida, another state with a large Hispanic population that has moved its primary to Jan. 29.</p>
