        <p>A nanny was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 17 years in prison for the death of a 19-month-old boy. The nanny, Tammy Williams, 43, of East New York, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, admitting that in March 2005 she put duct tape over the boy's mouth to stop his crying. The boy, Jaylen Robinson, suffocated. Prosecutors have said that Ms. Williams's daughter was a witness to the killing. In court yesterday, an assistant district attorney, Jacqueline Kagan, said the plea agreement ''will save the defendant's own child from having to testify against her.'' A defense lawyer, Peter J. Guadagnino Jr., said that Ms. Williams was in poor mental health and that ''I know she's very sorry for what she did.''</p>
