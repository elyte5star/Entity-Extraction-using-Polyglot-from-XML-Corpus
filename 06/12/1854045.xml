        <p>A developmentally disabled man who was born and raised in Los Angeles County and is a United States citizen was illegally deported to Mexico last month by immigration agents screening inmates at a jail, according to a federal lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. The man, Pedro Guzman, 29, of Lancaster, Calif., has now been reported missing in Tijuana, Mexico, family members said. The lawsuit accuses federal authorities of failing to ascertain his citizenship and refusing to help find him in Mexico. Mr. Guzman, who was serving a sentence for misdemeanor trespassing, said in a brief telephone conversation with a family member after he was removed that he told jailers he was born in California, the lawsuit said. Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the federal immigration agency, said it ''had no reason to believe that it improperly removed'' Mr. Guzman.</p>
