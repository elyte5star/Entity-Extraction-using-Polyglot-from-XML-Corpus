        <p>One man was shot dead on Monday and at least four people were wounded in clashes between the supporters of rival candidates in elections for the Shura Council, the upper house of the Egyptian Parliament.</p>
        <p>Government officials hailed the elections as a step toward democracy. But commentators described them as providing a sense of déjà vu, referring to rigging in favor of the governing party's candidates.</p>
        <p>The available results showed the National Democratic Party, the governing party, won 11 of the 88 contested seats because its candidates ran unopposed in those districts.</p>
