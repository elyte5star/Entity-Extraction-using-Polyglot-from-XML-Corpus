        <p>Jean-Paul Gut, the chief operating officer of EADS, quit Monday over what he called disagreements over policy and strategy, adding further turmoil to the company's top management one week before the Paris air show.</p>
        <p>In the last year, EADS -- formally, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company -- has faced harsh criticism over production delays at its flagship Airbus unit, as well as over multimillion-euro severance payments to the departing co-chief executive amid an insider-trading investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gut, 46, who worked with the company for 24 years, will be leaving on Oct. 1 because of disputes over how EADS organizes marketing and sales, he said in an interview published in the newspaper Le Figaro.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gut wanted to centralize those functions, together with strategy, for all of EADS's subsidiaries, its chief executives preferred to make them the responsibility of each subsidiary.</p>
        <p>In a statement, EADS acknowledged the dispute over organizational issues, but said there was no disagreement over strategy. Marwan Lahoud, 41, who since 2003 has headed MBDA, a joint venture that makes Exocet missiles, will succeed Mr. Gut, EADS said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lahoud was a contender for the EADS board last year, but his nomination was blocked because his brother had been investigated in a protracted political scandal known as the Clearstream affair.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Gut said he would receive a 2.8 million euro, or $3.7 million, severance package, but denied that it constituted a ''golden parachute.'' EADS said the severance pay of two years' salary -- a month for each year he had worked at the company -- strictly followed his employment contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gut will not be restricted from working for competing organizations.</p>
        <p>Severance payments became a political issue in France after the departure of Noël Forgeard as co-chief executive of EADS. Mr. Forgeard left last year after the announcement of major production delays in the Airbus A380, and received an 8.5 million euro payoff.</p>
        <p>The terms of his departure became public during the French presidential campaign, weeks after Airbus announced the elimination of 10,000 jobs, prompting the conservative candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, to urge limits on such payments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gut, who joined Matra Défense in 1983 at 22, took part in its merger with Aérospatiale and the creation of EADS. At 28, he was said to be the youngest director of sales in the global defense industry.</p>
        <p>His departure from the company marks the end of the era of the Lagardère Boys -- four ambitious young executives groomed and promoted by Jean-Luc Lagardère, who ran Matra missiles. Only one of the four, Fabrice Brégier, managing director of Airbus, remains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gut said he would set up his own company to advise French businesses looking to enter markets in the Middle East, China and India.</p>
