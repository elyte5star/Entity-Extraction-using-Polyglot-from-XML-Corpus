        <p>Computer Game Outrages The Church of England  The Church of England, accusing Sony of ''virtual desecration,'' called on the company yesterday to apologize and withdraw a PlayStation computer game that depicts a shootout in the nave of Manchester Cathedral, Reuters reported. ''For the global manufacturer Sony to recreate the interior of any religious building such as a mosque, a synagogue or in this case a cathedral with photo realistic quality and then encourage people to have gun battles in the building is beyond belief,'' said the Very Rev. Rogers Govender, the dean of Manchester Cathedral, who noted that three youths had been shot in the city within the past 72 hours. The church also called on Sony to contribute financially to combating the gun crime that has plagued Manchester. ''The video footage of the cathedral battle on YouTube has shocked and dismayed us beyond words,'' the dean said. Defending the game, ''Resistance: Fall of Man,'' and denying Manchester Cathedral's contention that it had not sought permission, Sony said, ''We believe we have sought and received all permissions necessary for the creation of the game.'' A spokesman said yesterday, ''We are now in contact with the cathedral authorities and will be dealing with them directly.''</p>
        <p>Guarneri Quartet Calls It Quits  After 45 years, the Guarneri String Quartet will retire at the end of the 2008-9 season. In a statement the members of the ensemble -- the violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley, the violist Michael Tree and the cellist Peter Wiley -- said they had decided that its 45th anniversary would be an appropriate time to exit. The quartet was founded in 1964 at the Marlboro Music Festival, and its personnel changed only once, in 2000, when Mr. Wiley replaced his mentor David Soyer.</p>
        <p>Violinist Turns Busker  David Juritz, the 49-year-old internationally renowned violinist who is concertmaster of the London Mozart Players and guest concertmaster of the Royal Philharmonic and London Philharmonic Orchestras, has taken to the streets. During the next five months he plans to play his way across 60,000 miles in 25 countries as a busker, to raise $1 million for charities that bring music to poor children, The Times of London reported. ''Having spent the last 25 years in concert halls, I thought I would give myself something different to do,'' said Mr. Juritz, who will turn 50 during his travels. Starting out last week with an empty wallet on what he calls his ''Round the World and Bach'' tour, Mr. Juritz, who was heard on the soundtrack of ''The Last King of Scotland'' and has recorded with the Sugarbabes, said he would play mainly Bach partitas. If all goes well, he will visit Europe, Africa, Australia, India, Hong Kong and South America before finishing in the United States. ''From now until October, I will just have my backpack and violin and hope the people I play for on the street enjoy what I do enough to make a contribution,'' he said. ''I will rely on my busking earnings to finance the trip. I may have an audience of a man and a dog at some places, but I hope they like what I do.''</p>
        <p>New Stephen King Thriller  A secluded Florida key. A newly arrived bereaved mother. A madman for a neighbor. These are the ingredients of a new Stephen King thriller to be published today in the July issue of Esquire, The Associated Press reported. ''Over the last year we've been trying to breathe life back into magazine fiction,'' David Granger, the magazine's editor in chief said yesterday. ''The best way to do that is to publish nothing other than event fiction-stories that have something in addition to their literary merit to call attention to themselves.'' Mr. King's 21,000-word, 23-page novella is titled ''The Gingerbread Girl.'' Esquire has a long history of publishing original fiction, including works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Truman Capote and Norman Mailer.</p>
        <p>Home Crowd Roots For Rolling Stones  Some 60,000 fans turned out to hear the Rolling Stones perform at a British music festival for the first time in more than 30 years, when they delivered a two-hour set on Sunday night to close the Isle of Wight Festival, Agence France-Presse reported. Besides hits including ''Satisfaction,'' ''Sympathy for the Devil'' and ''Brown Sugar,'' the Stones played songs from their new album, ''A Bigger Bang,'' and featured duets with Amy Winehouse and Paolo Nutini. ''Coming back home is always like a bit more special,'' the guitarist Keith Richards, above, told Virgin Radio. ''We just carry Britain with us really, our little bubble of it.'' The Stoneshad not performed in Britain since the Knebworth Fair in 1976.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 15, 2007, Friday  A report by Agence France-Presse in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column on Tuesday about the Rolling Stones' performance at the Isle of Wight Festival on Sunday night referred incorrectly at one point to the history of their appearances in Britain. As the report noted elsewhere, their performance at the Isle of Wight was their first at a British music festival since 1976. It was not their first in Britain since then.</p>
