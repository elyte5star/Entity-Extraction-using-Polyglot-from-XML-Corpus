        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In two recent articles -- ''After Sanctions, Doctors Get Drug Company Pay'' (front page, June 3) and ''Psychiatrists, Troubled Children and Drug Industry's Role'' (front page, May 10) -- you focused on psychiatrists in Minnesota, presumably because it's the one state with a robust law on disclosing pharmaceutical company payments to physicians.</p>
        <p>These articles raise important issues of concern to all of us: the influence of big business on health care.</p>
        <p>I have met many psychiatrists, the vast majority of whom, like me, haven't taken pharmaceutical money. We support full and honest disclosure. Our primary focus is our patients' well-being.</p>
        <p>The people I know are genuinely caring, hard-working doctors who chose to go into psychiatry to help people. They and their patients deserve to have that fact known. A June 2006 salary survey, for example, looked at pay for 59 medical specialties and found that psychiatrists ranked 48th. That's hardly a picture of greed.</p>
        <p>Jeff Hardwig, M.D.  International Falls, Minn.  June 5, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is president of the Minnesota Psychiatric Society.</p>
