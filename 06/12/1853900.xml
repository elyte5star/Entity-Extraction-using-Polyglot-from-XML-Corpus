        <p>According to the American Symphony Orchestra League, works composed by women amounted to 1 percent of the music played by 300 of its member ensembles in the 2004-5 season. That sobering if unsurprising figure was cited in the program for ''Notable Women,'' a three-weekend festival the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble is presenting at the Chelsea Art Museum and Dia:Beacon.</p>
        <p>The series was conceived and organized by Joan Tower, the composer in residence at the Orchestra of St. Luke's. The first program was devoted to pioneers like Amy Beach and Ruth Crawford Seeger; the third, scheduled for next weekend, will offer works by mavericks from experimental traditions, including Joan La Barbara and Julia Wolfe.</p>

        <p>According to the American Symphony Orchestra League, works composed by women amounted to 1 percent of the music played by 300 of its member ensembles in the 2004-5 season. That sobering if unsurprising figure was cited in the program for ''Notable Women,'' a three-weekend festival the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble is presenting at the Chelsea Art Museum and Dia:Beacon.</p>
        <p>The series was conceived and organized by Joan Tower, the composer in residence at the Orchestra of St. Luke's. The first program was devoted to pioneers like Amy Beach and Ruth Crawford Seeger; the third, scheduled for next weekend, will offer works by mavericks from experimental traditions, including Joan La Barbara and Julia Wolfe.</p>
        <p>It might be argued that most of the composers on the second program, heard in Chelsea on Saturday, needed no special pleading. Two of them, Ms. Tower and Libby Larsen, have long been among America's most esteemed composers. Tania León has served in prominent roles with the New York Philharmonic and the American Composers Orchestra. Jennifer Higdon's vivid, attractive works have made her a hot commodity lately.</p>
        <p>These, in other words, were representatives of that fortunate 1 percent, and the works representing them showed why. Ms. León's ''Singin' Sepia,'' a song cycle on texts by the poet Rita Dove, intertwined angular, leaping vocal lines with bristling counterpoint on clarinet and violin. Two pianists provided spiky accompaniment, with occasional undercurrents of wry swing. Tony Arnold, a bold, powerful soprano, gave a riveting account of the demanding work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tower's String Quartet No. 1, ''Night Fields,'' a sequence of dreamy meditations and stormy interludes, demonstrated her characteristic combination of sophisticated construction and tuneful approachability. The same could be said of Ms. Higdon's Trio for Violin, Cello and Piano. The work, she noted in her introductory comments, was well served by the concert's setting: The colors she meant to evoke in the work's two movements, ''Pale Yellow'' and ''Fiery Red,'' could be seen in a pair of Jean Miotte canvases that surrounded the players.</p>
        <p>The violinist Krzysztof Kuznik, the cellist Daire FitzGerald and the pianist Margaret Kampmeier provided a suitably vivid performance of Ms. Higdon's work. Another cellist, Myron Lutzke, replaced Ms. FitzGerald in Ms. Larsen's gently dissonant Trio for Violin, Cello and Piano.</p>
        <p>Both cellists were heard in ''I and Thou,'' a new piece commissioned from Kati Agocs, a gifted young composer who recently earned her doctorate from Juilliard. A brooding first movement, punctuated with courtly trills, segued into a second movement in which syncopated melodies were draped across chugging ostinatos. The performance could have used more polish, but the music warranted Ms. Agocs's inclusion in such notable company.</p>
        <p>''Notable Women'' continues on Saturday at 2 p.m. at the Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, and Sunday at 3 p.m. at Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (212) 594-6100 or oslmusic.org.</p>
