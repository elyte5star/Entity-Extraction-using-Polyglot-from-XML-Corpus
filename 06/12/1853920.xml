        <p>A mournful streak runs through the lyrics of Architecture in Helsinki, like these from ''The Cemetery'': ''I don't wanna fall face down/In the flood of the tears from the years that we loved and we messed up.'' But those words, like most of the band's set on Friday night at Fillmore New York (the renamed Irving Plaza), arrived with manic glee.</p>
        <p>Architecture in Helsinki, which is actually an Australian band from Melbourne, breathlessly crammed together all its favorite pop and rock devices. There were funk bass lines, nonsense syllables sung in harmony, new wave guitar licks, double-time raps, ska trombone riffs, intricate minimalist counterpoint, bounding Caribbean-flavored rhythms, growls and shrieks. Songs started in one zone and ended up in another: a cowbell-driven stomp led to a chorale, and a Miami disco vamp dropped to half speed, then reawakened with chiming Congolese-style guitars. And the lyrics wandered from frustrated love to portents of violence to madcap non sequiturs. ''We're leaping off the edge of this world,'' Cameron Bird sang as the set began.</p>

        <p>A mournful streak runs through the lyrics of Architecture in Helsinki, like these from ''The Cemetery'': ''I don't wanna fall face down/In the flood of the tears from the years that we loved and we messed up.'' But those words, like most of the band's set on Friday night at Fillmore New York (the renamed Irving Plaza), arrived with manic glee.</p>
        <p>Architecture in Helsinki, which is actually an Australian band from Melbourne, breathlessly crammed together all its favorite pop and rock devices. There were funk bass lines, nonsense syllables sung in harmony, new wave guitar licks, double-time raps, ska trombone riffs, intricate minimalist counterpoint, bounding Caribbean-flavored rhythms, growls and shrieks. Songs started in one zone and ended up in another: a cowbell-driven stomp led to a chorale, and a Miami disco vamp dropped to half speed, then reawakened with chiming Congolese-style guitars. And the lyrics wandered from frustrated love to portents of violence to madcap non sequiturs. ''We're leaping off the edge of this world,'' Cameron Bird sang as the set began.</p>
        <p>Architecture in Helsinki's music is art-pop with its heart in the early 1980s, when new wave bands countered the reductionism of punk with full-tilt eclecticism. The band can't help echoing Talking Heads, which dipped into many of the same styles, and when Mr. Bird pushed his voice into a cartoonish rasp to be answered by Kellie Sutherland belting clear melodies, there was an unmistakable echo of the B-52s.</p>
        <p>Songs from the band's coming album, ''Places Like This'' (Polyvinyl), sometimes flaunted the resemblances too closely; it would be a shame if Architecture in Helsinki reduced itself to a revival. Onstage, however, the ideas arrived in a joyful, inexhaustible rush. The band's new single, ''Heart It Races,'' had a line in its chorus about ''made his wife a widow,'' but with its throbbing synthesizer bass line, steel drum sounds and a singalong of ''boom dah-dee dah-dee dah-dee,'' it was too much fun to ponder darker thoughts.</p>
        <p>Still, the band has some. ''Places Like This'' is due for release in August, but some audience members were already familiar with the songs because it has leaked online. Mr. Bird introduced an older song by dedicating it to ''everyone that's downloaded our new album,'' doubtless for its title: ''Maybe You Can Owe Me'' (from the band's 2005 album, ''In Case We Die''). As the set ended, another band member urged the audience to buy CDs and T-shirts before leaving: to ''do the right thing, support music.'' Afterward the merchandise booth was mobbed.</p>
