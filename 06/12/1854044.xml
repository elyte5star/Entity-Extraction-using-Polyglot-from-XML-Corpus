        <p>A French aid worker with the group Doctors Without Borders was killed in a volley of gunfire in an area of this vast and lawless country that had recently suffered through a rebel attack and army reprisals. The worker, a 27-year-old logistics specialist named Elsa Serfass, was part of an assessment mission that was sent to evaluate the medical needs of displaced villagers, the latest victims of an increasingly violent conflict between rebels in the northwest of the country and government troops. Dozens of villages have been set on fire in the last 18 months as the army has tried to flush out the rebels, forcing nearly 300,000 to flee their homes.</p>
