        <p>The Supreme Court agreed to allow its suspended chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, to contest his removal by President Pervez Musharraf before the full court. Mr. Chaudhry, who had become increasingly independent, was suspended in March on the ground that he had misused his office. The dismissal set off a nationwide backlash that has created the greatest challenge to the rule of General Musharraf since he seized power in a coup in 1999.</p>
