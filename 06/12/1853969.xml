        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-12</p>
        <p>Iraqi Minister Pressured By U.S. for War Progress  The top American military commander for the Middle East warned Iraq's prime minister in a closed door conversation that the Iraqi government needed to make tangible political progress by next month to counter the growing opposition to the war in Congress.  A1</p>
        <p>The Iraqi Parliament approved a resolution that would force the resignation of the speaker, Mahmoud Mashadani. The vote underscored the widespread discontent with Mr. Mashadani, a Sunni Arab politician who has done little to build consensus among Iraq's political blocs.  A8</p>
        <p>In Egypt, Abundant Fatwas  Fatwa, or Islamic religious edicts, have become a cause for controversy in Egypt. The complaint has been the subject of recent conferences as government-appointed arbiters of Islamic standards say the fatwa free-for-all has led to the promotion of extremism and intolerance.  A1</p>
        <p>U.N. Warning to U.S. and Iran  The director general of the United Nations nuclear inspection agency warned Tehran and Washington for the first time that their stalemate over Iran's nuclear activities was turning into a confrontation that ''urgently needs to be defused.'' A8</p>
        <p>Palestinian Infighting Rages  The worst factional fighting in nearly a month raged among Palestinians, with gunmen reportedly firing at the prime minister's home and office. Violence elsewhere in Gaza left at least nine people dead.  A12</p>
        <p>Nairobi Hit by Blast  An explosion rocked Nairobi, killing one person and wounding 31 others. Witnesses said three men carrying a small bomb tried to squeeze onto a crowded bus, but when they were pushed off by other passengers, the bomb exploded. A12</p>
        <p>In Kabul, Bomb Like Ones in Iraq  Afghan security forces found a bomb of the type used in Iraq in Kabul last month, the first time such a device has been discovered in the capital. The bomb was primed to hit a convoy of Afghan officials or international forces, the official said. A8</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A13-21</p>
        <p>Detention of 'Combatants' In U.S. Rejected by Court  The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled that the president may not declare civilians in this country to be ''enemy combatants'' and have the military hold them indefinitely, a stinging rejection of the Bush administration's central assertions about the scope of executive authority to combat terrorism.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Vote Against Gonzales Blocked  Senate Republicans blocked a symbolic no confidence vote against Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, dismissing the measure as an irrelevant gesture, though Democrats had hoped it might intensify pressure on Mr. Gonzales to resign.  A1</p>
        <p>Dog Breeders Using DNA Tests  As dog breeders apply scientific precision to their art, they find that the quest for genetic perfection comes with unforeseen consequences. And the lessons of intervening in the nature of dogs may ultimately bear as much on humans as on their best friends.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Senate Debates Energy Bill  With gasoline prices hovering near all-time highs, the Senate began debating a sprawling energy bill that has already kicked off an epic lobbying war by huge industries.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Man in Sex Case Ordered Freed  A judge ordered the release of a man who is serving a widely criticized 10-year prison sentence without parole for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a party four years ago. But Georgia's attorney general, Thurbert E. Baker, said he was appealing the order.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Guards Accused of Smuggling  Three members of the Texas National Guard helping patrol the Mexican border have been charged with human smuggling after federal agents found one of the soldiers in uniform driving a van crammed with 24 illegal immigrants north of Laredo.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Disparity in Law to Be Reviewed  The Supreme Court, expanding its review of federal criminal sentencing, agreed to consider the proper judicial response to the sharp disparity in the way the law treats crack cocaine and cocaine powder.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-6</p>
        <p>Police Cite Gang Activity In Rash of Parade Arrests  The New York police disclosed that 208 people were arrested at the Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday -- far more than in previous years -- after reports that members of the Latin Kings gang planned to join the parade. But several of those arrested said they had simply been swept up with the crowd and denied having any gang associations. B1</p>
        <p>Silver Criticizes Traffic Plan  Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, in his strongest language yet against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to charge people who drive into the most congested parts of Manhattan, suggested that many of the environmental goals the mayor has outlined could be met without congestion pricing.  B1</p>
        <p>SCIENCE TIMES F1-8</p>
        <p>Science Flirts With Invisibility  Increasingly, physicists are constructing materials that bend light the ''wrong'' way, an optical trick that could lead to sharper-than-ever lenses or maybe even make objects disappear. F1</p>
        <p>Findings in Animal Migration  The first aerial survey of southern Sudan in 25 years has revealed vast migrating herds, rivaling those of the Serengeti plains, that have managed to survive 25 years of civil war, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Southern Sudan will announce at a news conference.
