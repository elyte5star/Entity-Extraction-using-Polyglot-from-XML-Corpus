        <p>7 P.M. (Cinemax) HAVE YOU SEEN ANDY? -- In August 1976 Andy Puglisi, 10 (middle, in turtleneck), disappeared from a public pool in Lawrence, Mass., where he was playing with dozens of children, including Melanie Perkins. In this documentary Ms. Perkins, now a filmmaker, looks for answers through interviews with other neighborhood children, Andy's family, police officers and forensics experts, and uncovers new evidence in this still unsolved case.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) AMERICA'S GOT TALENT -- Tonight the show's celebrity judges, David Hasselhoff, Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne, decide which Los Angeles auditioners will advance to the Las Vegas callbacks. Jerry Springer is host.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) ON THE LOT -- The director David Frankel (''The Devil Wears Prada'') is guest judge alongside the regulars Carrie Fisher and Garry Marshall.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) FAST CARS &amp; SUPERSTARS: THE GILLETTE YOUNG GUNS CELEBRITY RACE -- Serena Williams may be a whiz on the tennis court, but racing apparently isn't in her blood, leaving her the first celebrity driver to be taken off the track in this reality series. Tonight the former N.B.A. player John Salley, the W.W.E. wrestler John Cena and the singer Jewel put their pedals to the metal under the tutelage of the Nascar racer Carl Edwards.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) MI-5 -- Tonight the team of counterterrorism officers led by Tom Quinn goes after terrorists who have seized the Turkish embassy in London and hit close to home, taking Zoe Reynolds hostage.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Logo) KATE CLINTON: 25TH ANNIVERSARY TOUR -- Ms. Clinton, who calls herself ''a faith-based, tax-paying, America-loving political humorist and family entertainer,'' performs from her ''It's Come to This'' tour, sponsored by the National Center for Lesbian Rights.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (A&amp;E) CRISS ANGEL MINDFREAK -- In a torturous double header Mr. Angel lies on a bed of broken glass as a steamroller goes over his body; at 10:30 he tries to escape a caged truck filled with explosives while locked in a mailbag.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (WE) SECRET LIVES OF WOMEN -- A look at cougars: older women who, um, prey on younger men.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Oxygen) BAD GIRLS ROAD TRIP -- In this new series, Leslie, Aimee and Zara from Season 1 embark on a road trip, with stops at each woman's hometown, to find even worse contestants for Season 2.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (13) THE RHYTHM OF MY SOUL: KENTUCKY ROOTS MUSIC -- A history of Kentucky roots music -- a mélange of country, gospel, mountain and bluegrass -- through film clips of Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn and Ricky Skaggs, shown picking a mandolin at 8.</p>
