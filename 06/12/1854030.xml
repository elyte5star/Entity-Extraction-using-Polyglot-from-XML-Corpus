        <p>Gelsey Kirkland, right, returning to American Ballet Theater as a performer after 23 years, suffered a burn to her hand during a performance of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' at the Metropolitan Opera House on Saturday night, the company said. Ballet Theater, in a terse statement, did not describe how the burn happened or its seriousness, but appearances by Ms. Kirkland's character, the evil fairy Carabosse, are accompanied by pyrotechnics. Ballet Theater said Ms. Kirkland had been treated by doctors from the company and the Met and was taken to the emergency room at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital as a precaution. She was treated and released, and returned to work, the company said. Kristi Boone replaced her in the second act on Saturday. Ms. Kirkland joined Ballet Theater in 1974 and danced with it for 10 years. She collaborated with Kevin McKenzie, the company's director, in staging this ''Sleeping Beauty.''</p>
