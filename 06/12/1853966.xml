      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb pleaded guilty on Monday to making false statements to a federal agency, ending an unusual criminal case involving its blockbuster blood-thinning drug Plavix.</p>
        <p>The case involved accusations that the company had entered a secret deal to head off generic competition to Plavix, its biggest-selling product. The investigation began last summer with a search of the company's Manhattan headquarters by federal agents and it led to the dismissal of the chief executive, Peter R. Dolan.</p>
        <p>But the investigation ended with relatively minor charges against the company. During a 30-minute hearing in federal court here, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina fined Bristol-Myers $1 million. The sentence had been worked out beforehand in an agreement between the company and the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p>
        <p>While the company pleaded guilty to making false statements, after the hearing it issued a statement saying that it was merely taking responsibility for the actions of one former executive.</p>
        <p>''First and foremost, from our perspective there was no 'side agreement' of any kind with Apotex not to launch an authorized generic version of Plavix,'' the Bristol-Myers chief executive, James M. Cornelius, said in a letter to employees.</p>
        <p>The accusations involved statements reportedly made by Dr. Andrew Bodnar, a former executive of Bristol-Myers. Dr. Bodnar, an adviser to Mr. Dolan, had been given an important assignment last year -- settle a patent dispute with the Canadian generic drug maker Apotex.</p>
        <p>Apotex had threatened to market a generic version of Plavix before the patent expired in 2011. The threat, and a related federal court case in Manhattan, had weighed heavily on Bristol-Myers's stock.</p>
        <p>During settlement negotiations in May 2006, Dr. Bodnar reportedly suggested that Bristol-Myers would not market its own generic version of Plavix. Brand-name drug makers frequently sell generic versions of drugs to compete with generic manufacturers. Such an agreement would have given Apotex exclusive generic rights to the drug for at least six months.</p>
        <p>Under an existing consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, any such settlement agreement by Bristol-Myers had to be cleared by the agency. But an agreement by Bristol-Myers not to sell its own generic was never disclosed to the F.T.C., and the agency began investigating whether the companies had entered a secret ''side deal.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to Bristol-Myers' employees after Monday's hearing and in a statement to the media, the company announced that it had entered the plea to take responsibility for the actions of its former senior executive, an apparent reference to Dr. Bodnar, but it insisted that there was never a secret deal with Apotex.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers said that the former executive -- a reference to Dr. Bodnar -- made statements that ''he expected to oppose personally the launch of an authorized generic in the future,'' that he ''expected to advocate against such a launch,'' and that he implied ''that the company's former C.E.O. shared his views.''</p>
        <p>Neither Dr. Bodnar, who is no longer with the company, nor Mr. Dolan has been charged with any wrongdoing. Both have repeatedly declined to comment. The patent case, meanwhile, was not settled and was tried in January. A ruling is pending.</p>
