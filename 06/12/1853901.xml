        <p>From its inception, in 1948, the Aldeburgh Festival has been a place where old and new music happily, sometimes provocatively, coexist. In his program book essay for the 60th anniversary of the festival, now under way, the critic Paul Griffiths reminds us that the inaugural festival, which lasted a week, offered ''new works by young composers, Mozart chamber music, songs by Britten and Schubert, a new small-scale opera, a recital by a great pianist and a dash of Purcell -- things that were to be replicated in virtually every festival since.''</p>
        <p>Including the current one, which began on Friday and runs through June 24. Here, following tradition is never a timid choice, because the Aldeburgh tradition, as put in place by the co-founders (Britten, the tenor Peter Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier) is so dynamic.</p>

        <p>From its inception, in 1948, the Aldeburgh Festival has been a place where old and new music happily, sometimes provocatively, coexist. In his program book essay for the 60th anniversary of the festival, now under way, the critic Paul Griffiths reminds us that the inaugural festival, which lasted a week, offered ''new works by young composers, Mozart chamber music, songs by Britten and Schubert, a new small-scale opera, a recital by a great pianist and a dash of Purcell -- things that were to be replicated in virtually every festival since.''</p>
        <p>Including the current one, which began on Friday and runs through June 24. Here, following tradition is never a timid choice, because the Aldeburgh tradition, as put in place by the co-founders (Britten, the tenor Peter Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier) is so dynamic.</p>
        <p>On Saturday afternoon, for example, the British a cappella vocal ensemble Exaudi, founded five years ago, gave a concert at the parish church in the neighboring Suffolk town of Orford that boldly juxtaposed late Renaissance and contemporary Italian music. The impact of Italy on Britten and, in a way, on Britain, is a recurring theme of this year's festival, an idea inspired by the presentation of ''Death in Venice,'' which opened the festival on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Exaudi -- 12 musically superb and technically accomplished singers, 4 women and 8 men, directed by James Weeks -- first set a contemplative mood by singing plainchant. This was followed by ''Three Tenebrae Responsories'' by Gesualdo, the aristocratic composer (about 1561-1613) of intensely chromatic vocal works.</p>
        <p>The still shocking harmonic shifts and pungent dissonances in Gesualdo's music are heard by some as evidence of a deranged mind. Gesualdo is a legendary murderer, having stabbed his wife and her secret lover when he found them in bed together and proudly displayed their corpses outside his castle. But many great composers, notably Stravinsky, have been strong admirers of Gesualdo's works, and Exaudi's performances here were luminous and haunting. They captured the murky mood of the music, which, in the reverberant acoustics of the beautiful church, dating partly from Norman times, had a hallucinatory effect.</p>
        <p>The performance served as an effective conduit to ''Responsorio Della Tenebre'' (2001) by the Italian modernist Salvatore Sciarrino. This was like a riff on Gesualdo, with passages of plainchant alternating with harmonically piercing, quietly tormented and riveting ruminations.</p>
        <p>The composer Nicolò Castiglioni's ''Hymne'' (1988-89), new to me, was another work steeped in ancient music yet utterly modern. The final section, in which block harmonies shift abruptly to seemingly random chords, each inaugurated with a stabbing accent, was arresting.</p>
        <p>After a break, works by Monteverdi served as bookends to a performance of Giacinto Scelsi's ''Tre Canti Sacri'' (1958), a piece of breathtaking originality in which pungent cluster chords alternate with unconventional vocal sound: groans, whines and quavering sustained tones.</p>
        <p>Luigi Nono's astringently beautiful ''Sarà Dolce Tacere'' (1960) concluded the program. Do all the singers in Exaudi have perfect pitch? I doubt it. Yet how else to explain that they were able to find and hold the pitches during the skittish, leaping passages of this complex 12-tone score?</p>
        <p>In the evening, at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall, where the production of ''Death in Venice'' had its premiere the night before, there was a recital by the pianist Alfred Brendel, an Aldeburgh regular. Though I have always had deep respect for Mr. Brendel's artistry, when he strives to play the Viennese classic masters with reverence and almost mystical seriousness, the performances can take on an aloof quality. But Mr. Brendel has said that he finds the away-from-it-all atmosphere of Aldeburgh very refreshing and believes that he has given some of his finest performances here. This was surely one.</p>
        <p>He began with Haydn's Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI:20), an elusive work that seldom turns up on recital programs. Mr. Brendel was alert to all the bold strokes in the score, playing with beautiful shadings and serene vitality.</p>
        <p>Next he gave an Apollonian and elegant account of Beethoven's late Sonata No. 31 in A flat. Two Schubert impromptus after intermission, gracefully performed, led to the final work, Mozart's stormy Sonata in C minor (K. 457), in which Mr. Brendel's way with the elaborately lyrical slow movement proved particularly poignant.</p>
        <p>The festival seems to be thriving under its current leadership, with the adventurous young British composer Thomas Adès as artistic director, the composer John Woolrich as his associate, and Jonathan Reekie as chief executive. The expanding Aldeburgh enterprise is now called Aldeburgh Music, to denote that the festival is transforming itself into a yearlong program of performances, residencies and training for young musicians and artists.</p>
        <p>To this end, Aldeburgh Music is in the midst of converting additional buildings from the old malting mill in Snape into a campus with studios, rehearsal rooms, galleries and social spaces. Some $24 million has been raised, but the construction is on hold during the festival.</p>
        <p>Like the festival's godfather Britten, Mr. Adès, one of the most brilliant composers of his generation, is a comprehensive musician: a resourceful pianist as well as an incisive conductor. I wish I could be here next weekend when he conducts the Philharmonia Orchestra in an eclectic program of ''decadence and excess,'' in his description, with works by Liszt, Busoni and Respighi (''Feste Romane'' in a nod to the Italian theme), along with his own new orchestral suite drawn from his wild opera ''Powder Her Face.'' Britten would surely have approved.</p>
        <p>The Aldeburgh Festival continues through June 24: aldeburgh.co.uk.</p>
