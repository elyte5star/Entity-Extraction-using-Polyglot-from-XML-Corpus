        <p>The first primary votes are still more than half a year off, but the next installment of an important proxy contest -- the money primary -- is only weeks away. So the presidential candidates are all shaking the money tree this week, hoping for impressive tallies after the second quarter-reporting period ends June 30.</p>
        <p>Several candidates are prospecting in California, including Senator Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>John Edwards tried something a little different for his birthday Sunday. His campaign posted a video on YouTube of two of his top aides, Joe Trippi and Jonathan Prince, baking him a pecan pie and asking donors to give $6.10 to commemorate the date of his birth, $19.53 for the year he was born or $54 to match his age. The campaign said it took in a quarter of a million dollars from 10,000 donors.</p>
        <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to raise more than $2 million this week using more tried and true methods, according to a recent internal fund-raising memorandum, with events in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, and in Oklahoma and Texas. Rudolph W. Giuliani has events set in Pennsylvania this week.</p>
        <p>Money matters, and not only for what it can buy. Mr. McCain's weak first-quarter showing created the perception that his campaign was struggling; Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama got a bounce from their strong showings. Now the campaigns are trying to manage expectations for the second quarter, to put the best spin on whatever the bottom line shows.</p>
