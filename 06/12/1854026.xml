        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Cars and Bikes Can Mix, When the Rules of the Road Are Clear'' (Personal Health, June 5): I applaud Jane Brody's column on bicycle safety, but I differ strongly on one point. If you're the cyclist, the first rule of safe cycling is to prevent violent contact between any human and anything harder than a human, such as an automobile. All the subsequent rules are only means to this end. The laws of physics are applied without favoritism, and there is no court of appeal.</p>
