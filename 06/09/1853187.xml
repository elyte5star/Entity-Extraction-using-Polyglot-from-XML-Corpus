        <p>A report by the anticorruption organization Global Witness found that profits from smuggled and mishandled cocoa had helped pay for the civil war that has split the country for the past five years. It said that at least $118 million from the cocoa trade in Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, was used by the government, which controlled the south, and the rebels who controlled the north, to fuel the conflict and enrich its leaders. Valuable mineral resources like diamonds, oil and gold have spawned and fueled vast conflicts across Africa for decades, and the research in Ivory Coast demonstrated how a valuable cash crop can play a similar role, Global Witness said.</p>
