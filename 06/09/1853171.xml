        <p>Norilsk Nickel, the Russian nickel and palladium producer, said its profit more than doubled in 2006, as a result of soaring metals prices. Norilsk reported net profit of $5.99 billion, up from $2.36 billion in 2005, mostly because of a run-up over the period in the price of nickel. Analysts said growth in demand for steel in China was driving the increase. Revenue was $11.55 billion, up from $7.17 billion. Anticipating the jump in profits, two investment banks in Moscow issued reports last week identifying Norilsk's stock as undervalued. Still, the company is in the midst of a potentially destabilizing change in ownership as the two principal Russian shareholders are unwinding a decade-long partnership. Norilsk produces a fifth of all nickel and half of all palladium in the world at its mine above the Arctic Circle in Siberia.</p>
