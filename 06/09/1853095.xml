        <p>The Spanish police arrested the leader of the political wing of the violent Basque separatist group ETA on Friday. The move signaled a new government crackdown after the group renounced a 15-month cease-fire earlier this week.</p>
        <p>The police detained Arnaldo Otegi, leader of the outlawed political party Batasuna, in the northern town of San Sebastián, an official from the National Court said. Mr. Otegi was convicted last year of making comments in support of terrorism but allowed to remain free while he was appealing the case.</p>
        <p>His arrest is the latest in a series of moves that the Spanish and French authorities have taken against Basque separatists since Tuesday, when ETA formally ended its cease-fire. In practice, it was broken in December when ETA planted a car bomb at a Madrid airport, which killed two men and ended an attempt by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's government to broker a peace deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zapatero, a Socialist who has been accused of being soft on ETA by his conservative opposition and by some allies, pledged on Tuesday to clamp down on the group and its support network. In an interview on Spanish television Thursday, he denied that the government had eased up on ETA, and said 92 members of the group were arrested since the cease-fire began in March 2006.</p>
        <p>Pernando Barrena, a Batasuna spokesman, described Mr. Otegi's arrest as ''an extremely serious move'' and said at a news conference in San Sebastián that this week's measures against Basque separatists were ''an invitation to repression and dark days.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the government ordered José Ignacio de Juana Chaos, an ETA member convicted of 25 killings, back to prison after he had recovered from a 114-day hunger strike. In March, the government said it might let him serve his sentence at home because of health reasons, drawing anger from across the political spectrum and prompting hundreds of thousands to march in protest in Madrid.</p>
        <p>The gesture to Mr. de Juana, who has already served his sentence for the murders and is in jail on charges of inciting terrorism, was part of an attempt to keep the door open to reviving peace talks, according to a government official privy to Mr. Zapatero's thinking. ETA, which has been weakened in recent years by prosecutions and police tactics, carried out only small attacks of late, without killing anyone from May 2003 until last December.</p>
        <p>Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba said Wednesday, however, that it was ''evident that circumstances have changed.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, three people accused of belonging to ETA were arrested in southwestern France, where many of the group's operatives are in hiding. A woman, Alaitz Areitio Azpiri, 28, is suspected of recruiting and training ETA militants. One man, Aitor Lorente Bilbao, 40, had served seven years for weapons possession; another man, Igartua Echeverria, 37, had fled to France after a police operation against an ETA cell, the Interior Ministry said.</p>
        <p>The conservative Popular Party continued to insist this week that it would back Mr. Zapatero in the fight against ETA only if he ruled out further negotiations with the group.</p>
        <p>Edurne Uriarte Bengoechea, a political science professor at King Juan Carlos University in Madrid who is under threat from ETA, said she did not believe that this week's moves constituted a reversal of Mr. Zapatero's policy.</p>
        <p>''I think the government will continue to take these isolated measures, but without a fundamental change of attitude,'' Professor Uriarte said, which furthered the notion that Mr. Zapatero had still not clearly ruled out future negotiations.</p>
