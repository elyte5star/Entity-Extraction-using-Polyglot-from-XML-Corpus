        <p>Once his match was over and the final beads of sweat had trickled down Roger Federer's glistening face, he disappeared into the tunnel off the main court at the French Open. And for hours, he waited.</p>
        <p>He had just defeated fourth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets on Friday, 7-5, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7), to advance to the final at Roland Garros -- his record eighth Grand Slam tournament final in a row. But the question of whom he would play in that final still loomed.</p>
        <p>Would it be Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic who would stand between Federer and a fourth consecutive Grand Slam singles title?</p>
        <p>''I mean, I probably prefer Djokovic, to be honest,'' Federer said before that second match was done. ''Never lost against the guy, and the guy has never played in a Grand Slam final. So that would be stupid to say the other guy.''</p>
        <p>Hours later, Federer learned that his wish would not be granted. That other guy, Nadal, ended up defeating Djokovic, 7-5, 6-4, 6-2, to set up the match everyone has been waiting for.</p>
        <p>On Sunday at Roland Garros, it will be Roger versus Rafa, No. 1 versus No. 2, one of the best players in history versus the best in the world on clay. Neither would admit he had the edge.</p>
        <p>''He has already won the title twice, so I'd say he was the favorite,'' Federer said.</p>
        <p>Nadal said, ''He beat me the last time in Hamburg, but for that reason, maybe, he's the favorite.''</p>
        <p>So far, at least at Roland Garros, Nadal has had the secret to beating Federer. He defeated him in the finals last year, and in the semifinals in 2005. This year, he has not dropped a single set at this tournament, and he said this was his best clay court season ever.</p>
        <p>Just one tiny thing has marred Nadal's season so far: One week before the French Open, Federer finally figured out how to beat Nadal on clay, halting Nadal's 81-match winning streak on the surface. Federer had not beaten Nadal on clay in five previous matches.</p>
        <p>That victory -- a quite convincing 2-6, 6-2, 6-0 win in the final at the Masters Series tournament in Hamburg, Germany -- set up a perfect situation for Federer at this French Open. It may have given him the confidence that he needs to stop Nadal, the 21-year-old who has never lost here.</p>
        <p>Still, Djokovic, the sixth seed, said Federer would need much more than confidence to win on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''If you win on clay against him, you've got to do more, you've got to push him more, push him over the limits,'' he said. ''You've got to play really great tennis, and it has got to be your day.''</p>
        <p>Between matches at the French Open, Nadal squeezed in an excuse for his loss to Federer in Hamburg. He said he had been tired from playing in so many tournaments, then traveling home to Majorca to film commercials.</p>
        <p>Here, he has not shown any signs of fatigue, even off the court. For a show being broadcast pre- and post-tournament, he was videotaped singing ''La Bamba,'' in a type of karaoke gone wild. On the court, he said he felt loose, too.</p>
        <p>''I'm not playing for the Grand Slam, whereas he is playing for the Grand Slam,'' he said. ''Why should it be a pressure for me? I don't see why.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, whether he could feel it or not, Nadal was under pressure to make the final, at least from the fans. Djokovic, a 20-year-old Serb, stood between him and that achievement.</p>
        <p>Djokovic had a breakout tournament, weathering marathon matches and spectators who cheered his opponents. He was gracious, snapping off his wristband and handing it to a man in a wheelchair after winning his quarterfinal. He was expected to be one of the few players good enough to challenge Nadal or Federer.</p>
        <p>But after the semifinal, Djokovic was left shaking his head.</p>
        <p>''He's physically stronger than any other player on the Tour,'' he said of Nadal. ''I think that's his advantage.''</p>
        <p>Although Federer lacks Nadal's strength -- most notably the bulging biceps -- he is usually known as the Tour's most graceful player. That was not the case Friday. In an uncharacteristic display, Federer showed that he was human, looking clumsy as he made 45 unforced errors and saved 14 break points along the way.</p>
        <p>For Federer, there is pressure to be perfect, even on clay, his worst surface. He has set expectations unbelievably high. He has won 10 Grand Slam singles titles but at the French Open has always come up empty-handed.</p>
        <p>Federer's father, Robert, says that winning this tournament has been an important goal for his son. It is all he has thought about for the past four months, he said.</p>
        <p>''You can tell that he is feeling the pressure,'' Robert Federer said. ''When you have Grand Slam win after Grand Slam win, it's difficult. It is not as easy as everyone thinks.''</p>
