        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) RUFFIAN (2007) Right on the heels of the Belmont Stakes (5:30 p.m. on ABC), and with the memory of Barbaro still fresh, comes this drama about the horse heralded as the greatest thoroughbred filly of all time. After winning the Filly Triple Crown early in 1975, the undefeated Ruffian went on to run a ''battle of the sexes'' match against the Kentucky Derby winner Foolish Pleasure on July 6 at Belmont Park. The race ended in sorrow when, with Ruffian leading Foolish Pleasure by half a length, two bones in her right front leg snapped. After a 12-hour surgery, Ruffian caused further damage to herself when she thrashed around on the floor of her padded stall, and she was euthanized shortly after. The film, directed by Yves Simoneau (HBO's ''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee''), stars Sam Shepard, above, as Frank Whiteley, the trainer who guided Ruffian's ascent, and Frank Whaley as the sportswriter Bill Nack, who wrote the book the movie is based on.</p>
        <p>5 P.M. (Discovery Kids) BINDI THE JUNGLE GIRL -- Bindi Irwin, the 8-year-old daughter of the naturalist Steve Irwin, proves that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree -- or, more precisely, the custom-designed treehouse in which this new series is set. Because the show began production before the death of Mr. Irwin, who was killed by a stingray in September, he makes appearances in early episodes, including one at 5:30 that looks at elephants in Sri Lanka and Thailand.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (HBO) YOU, ME AND DUPREE (2006) An architect (Matt Dillon) and his wife (Kate Hudson), a teacher, find their newlywed bubble burst when their best man (Owen Wilson, above between Ms. Hudson and Mr. Dillon) -- who lost his job to attend their wedding -- moves in and overstays his welcome.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Hallmark) YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND (2007) Dylan McLaughlin plays a recently orphaned boy who moves to a new town to live with his aunt and uncle. There he befriends a reclusive Vietnam vet (John Schneider), who helps him build the soap-box-derby car that the boy and his father designed. Healing ensues, and the suds flow.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sci Fi) ICE SPIDERS (2007) The taglines just about say it all: ''They thought Melrose Place had vicious backbiting. They haven't seen anything yet.'' Patrick Muldoon and Vanessa Williams, above, and Thomas Calabro of ''Melrose Place'' infamy bare some fangs of their own in this sci-fi spoof. Mr. Muldoon and his band, the Sleeping Masses, also perform the song ''Get Off,'' heard during the final credits.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BBC America) THE GRAHAM NORTON SHOW -- Mr. Norton shoots the breeze about ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' the Oscars and other things Hollywood, with Orlando Bloom and Samantha Morton.</p>
