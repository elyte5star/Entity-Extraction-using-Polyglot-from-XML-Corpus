        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''City Traffic Pricing Wins U.S. and Spitzer's Favor'' (front page, June 8):</p>
        <p>As a New Jersey resident who drives into Manhattan with some frequency, I wholeheartedly endorse Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed congestion pricing. It's time to put the greater good ahead of our own convenience.</p>
        <p>Every time we drive with only one person or even two people in the car, we pollute more and finance both sides of the struggle against radical Islamic terrorism. If the federal funds are used to upgrade the mass transit system to make commuting easier, it will be a win-win situation for commuter and city resident alike.</p>
        <p>Roger Berkley  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., June 8, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding your article about New York City traffic congestion pricing, I am wondering if ill or disabled people would be exempt.</p>
        <p>My friend is 79 years old, legally blind and walking-disabled. She sees doctors in New York City, as well as entering the city for other matters. She must be driven door to door, and cannot take trains or buses.</p>
        <p>For such people, a physical hardship surely does not have to have an added financial hardship.</p>
        <p>Morton Linder  Mount Kisco, N.Y., June 8, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As an expat from Brooklyn, I look on the congestion pricing issue with two eyes. Primarily, I see a good idea whose time has come. But secondarily, I see a large problem with through traffic.</p>
        <p>What plans are for those who want to go from New Jersey to Queens and points east? If I come in through the Lincoln Tunnel, and want to drive straight across and out the Midtown Tunnel, will I still have to pay the $8 for going through the congestion?</p>
        <p>Or should I take the long way north on the George Washington Bridge, or south through Staten Island? Either would add time, gas wasted and stress to those who drive those routes.</p>
        <p>Luckily for me, my family lives in Brooklyn, and I live in Maryland, so I will not have to contemplate driving into Manhattan any time soon.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Poretsky  Rockville, Md., June 8, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While many sing the praises of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed ''congestion pricing'' for driving into Manhattan, I speak for those who are sick and do not have the money to pay the increased charges.</p>
        <p>As a cancer patient, I sought treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Patients and their families travel into Manhattan for numerous consultations, surgery and treatment. I traveled into Manhattan from the Bronx weekly for almost a year.</p>
        <p>As a person with limited income, I found parking fees a burden. Patients are too weak and at risk of infection to take public transportation. Even today, I have numerous doctor appointments in Manhattan. While I try to take public transportation, other health concerns make climbing stairs and walking many blocks a real challenge.</p>
        <p>Who will assist the weak and sick among us? Some can afford the additional expense, but those on limited income are unable to pay additional taxes.</p>
        <p>(Sister) Judith Brady  Bronx, June 8, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I can support some of the goals of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan, I fail to understand his continuing fascination with surveillance. It seems he wants to control everything New Yorkers smoke, eat, drink and drive, and monitor everything we do.</p>
        <p>This is his second attempt at widespread surveillance, and it must be stopped, as it sets a dangerous precedent. He, the governor and the Legislature must find another way to enable this program, and all Americans should be up in arms about this creeping tide of nannyism.</p>
