        <p>As summer fast approaches, the temperature in the deal world is rising as well. On Thursday, Biomet, a maker of artificial joints, accepted a sweetened $11.4 billion offer from a group of private equity firms.

        <p>On Monday, Avaya, one of the world's biggest makers of corporate phone equipment, agreed to an $8.2 billion deal with Silver Lake Partners and the Texas Pacific Group. The two private equity firms, which bested Nortel Networks in the bidding, will pay $17.50 a share.</p>
        <p>That same day, Palm said that it would sell a 25 percent stake in itself to Elevation Partners, a private equity firm that counts Bono among its co-founders, for $325 million. The sale comes as the company's cellphones lose market share to rival devices running the BlackBerry or Windows Mobile systems.</p>
        <p>And it was reported Monday that Cadence Design Systems, which makes the software that designs computer chips, has held talks with at least two private equity firms about going private.</p>
        <p>Though private equity has found resounding success in acquiring companies over the last two years, fears of rising interest rates may bring the buyout boom to a halt, as the debt fueling the acquisition spree becomes too expensive.</p>
