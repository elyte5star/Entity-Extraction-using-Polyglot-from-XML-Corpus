        <p>The composer Richard Wilson has had to wait so long for the New York premiere of ''In Schrafft's,'' his lively piece set to W. H. Auden's poem of the same title, that the once ubiquitous restaurant referred to is long gone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's work, written in 1968 and revised in 1979, was part of an enjoyable concert given by the New Amsterdam Singers, a fine amateur choir, and their music director, Clara Longstreth, at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan on Thursday. It featured 20th-century music by American and British composers set to poems by Yeats, Longfellow, Auden and Elizabeth Bishop about love, music, birds and blue-plate specials.</p>

        <p>The composer Richard Wilson has had to wait so long for the New York premiere of ''In Schrafft's,'' his lively piece set to W. H. Auden's poem of the same title, that the once ubiquitous restaurant referred to is long gone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's work, written in 1968 and revised in 1979, was part of an enjoyable concert given by the New Amsterdam Singers, a fine amateur choir, and their music director, Clara Longstreth, at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan on Thursday. It featured 20th-century music by American and British composers set to poems by Yeats, Longfellow, Auden and Elizabeth Bishop about love, music, birds and blue-plate specials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson scored Auden's poem for clarinet, marimba and harpsichord, with spoken, whispered and sung words. The piece begins on a whimsical note, with jagged, dissonant fragments tossed between the marimba and harpsichord, then progresses to a melodic, somber clarinet line.</p>
        <p>The marimba also had a starring role in Frank Lewin's ''Light Footfall,'' conveying special effects like the owl hooting in Yeats's poem ''The Cap and Bells.'' A violinist walking down the aisle opened the work with an evocative Celtic tune, followed by frantic, dissonant exchanges between the instruments and a barbershop quartet.</p>
        <p>Auden's poetry was also heard in Benjamin Britten's lovely ''Hymn to St. Cecilia,'' whose score was seized in 1942 by British customs officials who were worried about coded messages in the music.</p>
        <p>The rapid-fire words of the tricky second movement almost sound like Morse code. The singers ably navigated that movement, as well as the evolving moods of other sections, with a lilting pulse, clear diction and subtle dynamic shadings.</p>
        <p>The program opened with Ralph Vaughan Williams's a cappella ''Silence and Music,'' written in 1953 to a poem by Ursula Wood, his second wife. It features vivid word painting and rich, strikingly unpredictable harmonies.</p>
        <p>The harmonies were more straightforward in David Brunner's gentle ''I Am in Need of Music,'' set to Bishop's poem ''Sonnet.'' Stephen Sametz's short, intense ''I Have Had Singing'' was livelier, as was John Biggs's ''Birds,'' an amusing piece that uses terms for groups of birds, from the commonplace ''a gaggle of geese'' to the obscure ''chattering of choughs'' as the text.</p>
        <p>In ''Bird Songs,'' with appealing arrangements by Paul Crabtree, a composer influenced by rock music, soaring folk melodies were punctuated by spiky dissonance. The program also featured Howard Skempton's eclectic ''The Flight of Song,'' set to a poem by Longfellow, which includes an aleatoric section, with Longfellow's text interspersed with that of other poets; an edgy, chromatic movement; and wistful melodies.</p>
