        <p>A Syrian arms dealer under investigation for nearly 30 years was arrested Thursday night and charged in a sprawling plot to ship weapons -- including C-4 explosives and surface-to-air missiles -- to guerrillas in Colombia seeking to attack American forces serving there on antidrug missions, American prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The arms dealer, Monzer al-Kassar, was arrested by the Spanish authorities at Madrid Barajas International Airport as he arrived with two bodyguards on a flight from Malaga in southern Spain. Officials in New York said his arrest brought to a close not only a vast sting operation that stretched from Spain to Romania to New York City, but also the career of a globe-trotting criminal who played a role in the Iraqi insurgency and the Iran-contra affair.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kassar, 61, has been a wanted man since the early 1970s and is accused of selling weapons to terrorist groups and militias in Nicaragua, Brazil, Cyprus, Bosnia, Croatia, Somalia, Iran and Iraq, according to a federal indictment issued against him yesterday in New York. The indictment charges another Syrian man, Tareq Mousa al-Ghazi, with acting as Mr. Kassar's weapons broker and logistical expert, and a Chilean man, Luis Felipe Moreno-Godoy, with helping to organize his finances, who were arrested in hotels in Romania. Federal officials said they wanted to extradite all three men to New York.</p>
        <p>Officials in New York said that two Drug Enforcement Administration informants infiltrated Mr. Kassar's network last year and convinced him that they were seeking the weapons for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a leftist guerrilla group that has been battling the government for years. The informants offered to pay more than $8 million for assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and millions of rounds of ammunition to be shipped from factories in Romania and Bulgaria on a Greek cargo freighter to Colombia, the indictment says.</p>
        <p>He even offered to send a 1,000-man detachment from his private militia to help FARC fight American forces, the indictment says, and to send experts to train them in shaping plastic explosives into roadside bombs. He was also charged with agreeing to sell the group surface-to-air missiles for use against American helicopters in Colombia.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in New York, Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said Mr. Kassar planned to ship the weapons with false paperwork that claimed they were destined for Nicaragua. In exchange, he said, the two informants wired $400,000 of D.E.A. money from Manhattan to a Spanish bank account, saying that it was profit FARC had earned from selling cocaine.</p>
