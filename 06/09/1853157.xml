        <p>Julie Christie Onstage</p>
        <p>Julie Christie, who has not been on the British stage for more than 10 years, will take part in ''Cries From the Heart,'' an evening produced by Human Rights Watch at the Royal Court Theater on June 17. Ms. Christie, above, last appeared onstage in 1995, in a revival of Harold Pinter's ''Old Times'' in London. She will give an account based on the experience of a Somali woman whose husband and son were killed as they fled from war in Mogadishu. She will also read from the works of several poets. Among others scheduled to take part in the event are Eileen Atkins, Jeremy Irons, Ben Okri, Juliet Stevenson and Tom Stoppard.</p>
        <p>Pecking Order for Artists</p>
        <p>The German painter Gerhard Richter, below, enjoys the highest reputation of any living artist, followed by the American installation artist Bruce Nauman, according to an index compiled by the German magazine Capital, Bloomberg News reported. Art Compass (Kunstkompass), which the magazine has published annually since 1970, asks museum curators, critics and others to rank artists according to prestige; the index doesn't measure sales or prices. The German painter Sigmar Polke took third place, followed by the conceptual artist Rosemarie Trockel, the sculptor Louise Bourgeois and the photographer Cindy Sherman. The biggest gainer in this year's survey was Isa Genzken, a sculptor and installation artist living in Berlin who is responsible for this year's German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. She jumped 69 slots to move into 90th place.</p>
        <p>A New Boss For Berlin Museums</p>
        <p>Hermann Parzinger, an archaeologist, was named yesterday to run Berlin's museums, libraries and archives, replacing Klaus-Dieter Lehmann in March. Mr. Parzinger, 48, is the president of the German Archaeological Institute, and his appointment will put him in charge of the Prussian Culture Foundation, the biggest such institution in Germany, with museums like the Pergamon and the Neue Nationalgalerie. He will also oversee the reconstruction of Museum Island, a project that is expected to be completed in 2015 at a cost of 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion).</p>
        <p>No Jail Time for Singer</p>
        <p>A British judge said yesterday that she would not jail the singer George Michael, below, for driving while impaired, The Associated Press reported. Instead District Judge Katherine Marshall sentenced Mr. Michael to 100 hours of community service and banned him from driving for two years. The singer, whose real name is George Panayiotou, pleaded guilty on May 8; the police said that he was found slumped at the wheel of his car in north London after witnesses observed the vehicle slowly weaving onto the wrong side of the road in the early morning hours last Oct. 2. Mr. Michael, 43, told the court he was ashamed that ''I had done something really wrong in putting other people at risk.''</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>The choreographer Pina Bausch will receive the Kyoto Prize in the category of arts and philosophy, worth approximately $410,000. The Kyoto Prize is presented annually in this area and in the categories of advanced technology and basic sciences. ''More Shreks are coming!'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, at a news conference in Berlin. In addition to a fourth movie, he said, there are plans for a half-hour television special, ''Shrek the Halls,'' featuring the Shrek characters' versions of holiday traditions.</p>
