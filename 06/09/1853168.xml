        <p>After a decade in which grocery stores have consolidated to compete against the likes of Wal-Mart and Costco, the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday moved to block a merger between the biggest players in the natural foods and organic sector: Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Markets.</p>
        <p>In explaining the merger, the companies said they needed to combine forces to compete against larger operations like Wal-Mart and Kroger that are offering more and more organic and natural products.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. thought otherwise, saying such a merger would reduce competition -- and lead to higher prices -- in markets where Whole Foods and Wild Oats compete. The collapse of the deal wouldn't be such a big deal for Whole Foods, which is concentrating on opening expansive new stores. It would be a more serious blow to Wild Oats, which has struggled to compete with its larger rival.</p>
