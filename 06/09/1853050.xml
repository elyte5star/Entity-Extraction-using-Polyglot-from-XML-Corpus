        <p>BOROUMAND--Shahla, age 54, devoted wife, mother and friend, passed away at North Shore University Hospital on Thursday, June 7, 2007, following a courageous battle with brain cancer. Shahla was born April 12, 1953, in Tehran, Iran to Mohammad Taghi Boroumand and Moloud Shariat. Throughout her childhood, Shahla excelled at all levels of her education, graduating number one in her high school class. Upon graduation, Shahla attended Tehran University where she earned a degree in English Literature. 25 years ago, Shahla married Reza Jameh during a beautiful ceremony in Tehran, Iran. After moving to the United States, Shahla earned her real estate broker's license. While working for Caldwell Banker, Shahla developed a passion for interior design. Shahla's home was a showcase for her natural design sense as well as her class, style and sophistication. Shahla will be remembered by family and friends for her boundless acts of generosity and kind heartedness. Shahla is survived by her mother Moloud Shariat; husband, Reza Jameh; two sons, Arjang and Pedrom; two brothers Michael and Parviz; and her sister Giti. She is further survived by nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins and countless friends. Shahla will be dearly missed by all. Words cannot express the void that has been left by her passing.</p>
