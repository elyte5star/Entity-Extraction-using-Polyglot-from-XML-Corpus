        <p>THE problem with doing something well is that people expect you to do even better next time. Corporate profit margins -- earnings as a percentage of revenues -- have been running at close to all-time highs, but they can improve only so much.</p>
        <p>High margins in any industry are an invitation for fresh competitors to enter the marketplace and skim some of the cream. That puts a ceiling on margins in the best of times, and as the slowing of economic output in the first quarter showed, these are not the best of times.</p>
        <p>That could make revenue growth difficult and profit growth more difficult still. Companies can also improve margins by cutting costs, but there are limits to how much leaner and meaner they can become before the quality of their products and services begins to suffer. Think about the last time you called your bank or phone company.</p>
        <p>But some businesses will continue to expand their margins, even if economic growth remains tepid, by moving into fresh markets, introducing new and improved products and services or because they still have scope to improve productivity and bring in each dollar of revenue more cheaply than they used to.</p>
        <p>Stephen Biggar, director of American equity research at Standard &amp; Poor's, highlighted four constituents of his company's benchmark 500-stock index that fall into one or more of those categories.</p>
        <p>Comcast, the provider of cable television service, is continuing to increase revenue strongly. The high fixed costs that are a hallmark of the cable industry, and the tendency of customers to hang on to their service no matter what economic conditions are like, should help to ensure healthy margin expansion, he said.</p>
        <p>Department stores have been improving inventory control, Mr. Biggar noted. This means that merchandise lingers on the shelves for less time, resulting in higher prices. He expects the middle-to-up-market Nordstrom chain to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend.</p>
        <p>''Better inventory management makes stores more profitable,'' he said. ''If you don't have to keep as much on hand, you don't have to discount as much.''</p>
        <p>The two other choices are Schlumberger, the provider of oil field services, which is experiencing strong demand internationally, and Kellogg, the cereal maker, because it sells basic products and ''should benefit from restructuring and cost-cutting,'' Mr. Biggar said.</p>
        <p>AS a value investor, John Buckingham, chief portfolio manager for Al Frank Asset Management, is interested in finding companies that trade at bargain prices before he starts parsing corporate statements for evidence of exceptional growth prospects. But he pointed to several components of his portfolios that have been expanding profits and margins faster than the broad market and that are expected to keep doing so.</p>
        <p>His list includes several technology names, among them I.B.M. and three companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing: Texas Instruments, Applied Materials and Vishay Intertechnology. Mr. Buckingham's other selections include DuPont, Norfolk Southern, Walt Disney and FedEx.</p>
        <p>Barbara S. Walchli, manager of the Aquila Rocky Mountain Equity fund, looks for margin growth among companies that are adept at developing proprietary products and technologies that can command higher prices. Two favorites are suppliers of health care equipment: Merit Medical and Ventana Medical Systems.</p>
        <p>Merit is in a particularly good position because it has undertaken a restructuring program that she believes is about to pay off for the company and its shareholders.</p>
        <p>''They have spent a lot of money adding facilities and spending for new products, which have put temporary pressure on margins,'' Ms. Walchli said. ''They have a number of high-margin products to introduce this year. Margins should improve later this year and into 2008.''</p>
        <p>Technology product cycles often coincide with ups and downs in margins. Ms. Walchli expects Micron Technology, a manufacturer of memory chips, to benefit from Apple's introduction of the iPhone and from improvements to Microsoft's Vista personal computer operating system. The start of a product cycle tends to lift margins for chip makers, by spreading costs over a much greater number of chips.</p>
        <p>If economic sluggishness persists, pressure on margins across corporate America is likely to increase, but it will be alleviated eventually when commodity prices and interest rates fall, Ms. Walchli said. Until that happens, she said, ''companies that either can hold margins steady and grow the top line or expand margins should do well.''</p>
