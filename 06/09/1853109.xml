        <p>Mayor Cory A. Booker, who is facing a yawning budget deficit, announced on Friday that he would offer buyout packages to hundreds of city employees in an effort to forestall layoffs, tax increases or reductions in municipal services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Booker, whose administration must fill a $180 million gap by next spring, said workers who accepted early retirement packages would be eligible for up to 40 percent of their annual salary in one lump sum.

        <p>Mayor Cory A. Booker hopes to forestall layoffs, tax increases or service cuts by reducing the number of city employees in Newark.</p>

        <p>Mayor Cory A. Booker, who is facing a yawning budget deficit, announced on Friday that he would offer buyout packages to hundreds of city employees in an effort to forestall layoffs, tax increases or reductions in municipal services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Booker, whose administration must fill a $180 million gap by next spring, said workers who accepted early retirement packages would be eligible for up to 40 percent of their annual salary in one lump sum. But he said police officers and firefighters would be ineligible for the buyouts, which will be presented to the 5,877 municipal employees on Tuesday and take effect in July.</p>
        <p>''At this point, we don't know if layoffs are going to be necessary, but we have to find a way to balance our budget,'' Mr. Booker said.</p>
        <p>Bo Kemp, the city's business administrator, said that those whose buyouts were accepted would also have their health benefits paid for a limited time.</p>
        <p>If past buyouts are any indication, the reductions will not be overwhelming. In 2004, Mayor Sharpe James offered workers a similar buyout package that drew only 50 takers, said Luis Quintana, a council member who was a deputy mayor in the James administration.</p>
        <p>''If you're a guy making $40,000, a buyout isn't going to take you very far,'' Mr. Quintana said. ''A lot of people are just barely surviving on their salaries as it is.''</p>
        <p>Although she said she could not comment because she had not seen the buyout offer, Edith Behr, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service, said such programs put a financial strain on municipal governments in the short term but often lead to long-term savings. ''I have seen them work very well,'' said Ms. Behr, whose analysis helps determine Newark's municipal bond rating.</p>
        <p>On Friday, workers at City Hall were awaiting details of the offer and some expressed trepidation, saying they worried that if they did not accept a buyout package now they might be singled out for layoffs later.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people, especially the old-timers, are just holding their breath, waiting for the pink slips,'' said a 47-year-old clerk who declined to give her name because she did not want to appear to be disloyal to the administration.</p>
        <p>In the year since Mr. Booker took office, his campaign for fiscal austerity has fallen short of its goals to reduce the city's work force through attrition, and in fact, the staff has increased by 100 people, Mr. Kemp said.</p>
        <p>The mayor has drawn criticism for hiring a handful of department heads and deputies with six-figure salaries, and some residents are still seething over an 8.4 percent property tax increase that the Council passed last year.</p>
        <p>Rahaman Muhammad, president of the city's largest municipal union, said he was not aware of the incentive program until he was contacted by a reporter. He expressed disappointment in the move. ''You can put a pot of money in front of people, but what happens afterwards when there's no safety net?'' he asked. ''I'm not sure this is a good idea.''</p>
