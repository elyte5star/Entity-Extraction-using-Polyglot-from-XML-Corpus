        <p>After a barrage of criticism and nationwide protests by journalists and rights groups, the Pakistani government has suspended its restrictions on independent television stations.</p>
        <p>The restrictions, which had been approved by the president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, on Monday, gave the government sweeping powers to cancel licenses of independent television channels, seal buildings where it believed that illegal broadcasts were being shown and increased the fines for many violations. The move touched off angry but peaceful protests by thousands of lawyers, opposition activists and journalists across the country.</p>
        <p>Critical media coverage of the legal and political crisis that has erupted in the country since General Musharraf suspended the nation's chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, on March 9 appeared to have led to the media curbs.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, met with news media representatives and announced the formation of a six-member committee to review the amendments. It is composed of media representatives and government officials.</p>
        <p>It will present a report to the prime minister ''within the shortest possible time,'' according to a government statement, adding that until then the restrictions announced on Monday ''will not be initiated against electronic media.'' Analysts have described the protests against the suspension of the justice by lawyers and rights activists as the most serious crisis faced by General Musharraf since he took power in a coup in 1999.</p>
        <p>General Musharraf has repeatedly claimed that the news media have flourished under his rule. Independent television channels have mushroomed in the last couple of years. But live coverage of the rallies for the chief justice as he toured different parts of the country in recent months and critical talk shows on independent television channels seemed to have exasperated the government. Speeches and slogans against the president and the military were broadcast live to millions of households.</p>
        <p>Last week the government banned the live coverage of the rallies by the chief justice and pressed independent television stations to tone down the criticism in their talk shows, according to Pakistani journalists.</p>
        <p>But the restrictions on the news media announced Monday brought a powerful reaction by a vibrant local media and rights groups.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the government continued its efforts to soothe anger. ''The government believes in free media as well as addressing any concern about freedom of media through dialogue,'' Muhammad Ali Durrani, the Pakistani information minister, said while speaking at Parliament, according to state-run media.</p>
        <p>''No action of the government will lead to restrictions on media,'' Mr. Durrani assured the Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durrani, a soft-spoken media manager of the government, said the restrictions were not meant to put bars on news coverage, but were put in place for ''having a vigil on the malicious propaganda aired by certain TV channels, promoting sectarianism and extremism.'' The lifting of the news media restrictions was first reported by The Washington Post.</p>
