        <p>MAYBE senior executives really do not have a clue.</p>
        <p>There is a ''trust gap between consumers and global corporations, as well as a lack of understanding among business leaders about what consumers really expect from companies,'' The McKinsey Quarterly finds.</p>
        <p>For example, while 68 percent of executives said that large corporations made a ''generally'' or ''somewhat'' positive contribution to the public good, fewer than half (48 percent) of consumers agreed. The number was just 40 percent in the United States.</p>
        <p>When asked how much they trusted certain institutions to act in the best interest of society, European and American consumers put large global corporations at ''the bottom of the list -- beneath nongovernmental organizations, small regional companies, the United Nations, labor unions and the media,'' the McKinsey consultants Sheila M. J. Bonini, Kerrin McKillop and Lenny T. Mendonca wrote.</p>
        <p>The worldwide survey of 4,238 global business executives and 4,063 consumers also showed that ''executives have only a limited understanding of what issues are in the minds of consumers.''</p>
        <p>When asked what three concerns would be most important to them over the next five years, ''almost half of the consumers picked environmental issues, followed by pension and other retirement benefits, and health care.''</p>
        <p>''Executives predicted consumers would put job losses and offshoring first, followed by privacy and data security, and the environment.''</p>
        <p>WHAT, ME WORRY? One reason so many executives make so many mistakes is they are overly optimistic, Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economic science, says.</p>
        <p>''People assign much higher probability to the truth of their opinions than is warranted,'' Mr. Kahneman, a Princeton professor, said. ''This natural inclination to exaggerate our talents is amplified by a tendency to misperceive the causes of events. The typical pattern is for people to take credit for positive outcomes and to attribute negative outcomes to external factors, no matter what their true cause.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with Karen Christensen in Rotman Magazine, Mr. Kahneman gave a simple example. Mergers, he pointed out, tend to occur when the economy is expanding.</p>
        <p>''At such times, executives can overattribute their company's strong performance to their own actions and abilities, rather than to the buoyant economy,'' he said. ''Consequently, many M&amp;A decisions may be the result of hubris, as the executives evaluating an acquisition candidate come to believe that with proper planning and superior management skills they could make it work. Studies of postmerger performance suggest that, on average, they are mistaken.''</p>
        <p>One way managers could improve their decision-making abilities would be to analyze their mistakes systematically, but he added that was unlikely to happen. ''Executives don't like to be second-guessed, and procedures that are threatening to them are not likely to be adopted,'' Mr. Kahneman said.</p>
        <p>NUCLEAR REDUX? We are about to see a surge in applications to build nuclear power plants, spurred both by an increasing need for energy and concerns about the pollution that current power sources produce, EnergyBiz reports.</p>
        <p>''Starting this fall, the federal government anticipates that utilities will file license applications for as many as 30 new nuclear plants, the first such proposals in three decades,'' Martin Rosenberg writes.</p>
        <p>In an interview that made up part of a package in the magazine, R. William Borchardt, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's director for the office of new reactors, said it would take three to four years to evaluate the applications of new plants. Construction will take an additional three to four years, which means the plants probably will not be in operation before 2015.</p>
        <p>If approved, most of the plants will be in the South. There are now 104 nuclear power plants in the United States, according to EnergyBiz.</p>
        <p>FINAL TAKE -- From the ''sometimes being first is not a good thing'' department: Psychology Today reports 56 percent of M.B.A. students cheat, versus 47 percent of graduate students in other disciplines.</p>
