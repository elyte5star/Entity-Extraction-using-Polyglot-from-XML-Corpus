        <p>A trial that charges American and Italian intelligence operatives with kidnapping a radical imam in 2003 opened Friday in Milan, the first prosecution involving the contentious American policy of abducting terrorism suspects for interrogation elsewhere.</p>
        <p>It is a landmark case that will look into one of the United States' most secretive programs, called extraordinary rendition, and it risks straining relations between America and Italy, and embarrassing the secret services of both nations.</p>
        <p>But the first day was consumed with procedural issues. Then the trial adjourned for 10 days so the judge, Oscar Magi, could decide whether to suspend the trial temporarily.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers argued that the trial should be halted while the Constitutional Court rules on whether prosecutors violated state secrecy in bringing the case. That court's decision, not expected until later this year, could limit what evidence might be presented or could void the indictments entirely.</p>
        <p>''We need to have certainty about what evidence we can use,'' Titta Madia, a lawyer for the highest-profile defendant, Nicolò Pollari, Italy's former chief of military intelligence, told reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollari, who says he is innocent, was not at the trial, nor were the 26 Americans, including 25 Central Intelligence Agency operatives, who are charged with abducting the imam, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr. After the abduction in Milan, Mr. Nasr was jailed for four years in Egypt where, he says, he was tortured.</p>
        <p>The Italian government -- which neither wants the trial to proceed nor wants to risk worsened relations with the United States -- has not requested extradition. American officials have said they will not extradite the operatives even if asked.</p>
        <p>The chief prosecutor, Armando Spataro, said the case was important to show that terrorism should be fought with ''the full respect of the laws of Western democracies.''</p>
        <p>''We want punishment of the terrorists, but in the courtrooms,'' he told reporters. ''And we don't need to give to our enemies any reason for recruiting other members for their organizations.''</p>
