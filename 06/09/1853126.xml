        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-8</p>
        <p>Warm Reception Expected For Bush Visit to Albania  President Bush will be the first sitting American president to visit Albania. The country's support for the war in Iraq is nearly unanimous and it was one of the first allies to send troops to Afghanistan and one of the first to join the forces in Iraq.  A1</p>
        <p>Putin Elaborates on Missiles  President Vladimir V. Putin offered suggestions for alternatives to a missile defense system in Europe, saying Russia would not object to American interceptor missiles in Iraq, Turkey or at sea, and proposed that Russia and the West study emerging missile threats together. A6</p>
        <p>Report on Secret C.I.A. Prisons  In a report, the lead investigator for the Council of Europe gave a bleak description of secret prisons run by the Central Intelligence Agency in Eastern Europe, with information he said was gleaned from anonymous intelligence agents, many of whom wanted to unburden themselves. A7</p>
        <p>Separatist Arrested in Spain  The Spanish police arrested Arnaldo Otegi, the leader of the political wing of the violent Basque separatist group ETA, according to an official from the National Court. The move signaled a new government crackdown after the group renounced a 15-month cease-fire.  A4</p>
        <p>A Syrian arms dealer was arrested in Madrid and charged in a plot to ship weapons--including C-4 explosives and surface-to-air missiles--to guerrillas in Colombia seeking to attack American forces serving there on antidrug missions, American prosecutors said. A4</p>
        <p>Pakistan Lifts Media Strictures  After a barrage of criticism and angry but peaceful nationwide protests by journalists and rights groups, the Pakistani government has suspended its restrictions on independent television stations. The restrictions were originally imposed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf last March.  A7</p>
        <p>Italy Prosecutes C.I.A. Agents  A trial that charges American and Italian intelligence operatives with kidnapping a radical imam in 2003 opened in Milan, the first prosecution involving the contentious American policy of abducting terrorism suspects for interrogation elsewhere. A7</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A9-13</p>
        <p>Chairman of Joint Chiefs Will Not Be Reappointed  The Bush administration said it had decided not to reappoint Gen. Peter Pace to a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making him the highest-ranking officer to be a political casualty of the fight over Iraq.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Court Ruling is Criticized  A decision by the Supreme Court earlier this week that made it easier for prosecutors to exclude from capital juries people who express reservations about the death penalty will produce whiter and more conviction-prone juries, experts in law and psychology said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Paris Hilton Returned to Jail  The national obsession with celebrity collided head-on with the more serious issue of the equal application of justice, as a judge sent the socialite Paris Hilton back to jail some 36 hours after she was released with an ankle monitor for an unspecified medical problem.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>New Passport Rules Suspended  The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security formally announced they were temporarily suspending new passport requirements for travel to neighboring countries.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Wave of Youth Suicide  American Indian and Native Alaskan ages 15 to 24 are committing suicide at a rate more than three times the national average for their age group, according to the surgeon general.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Nominee Draws Criticism  President Bush's nomination of Dr. James W. Holsinger Jr., a Kentucky cardiologist, to be surgeon general is drawing criticism from gay rights groups, physicians and lawmakers who are troubled by his opinions critical of homosexuality that he voiced as a high-ranking layman in the United Methodist Church.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>A Smooth Shuttle Launching  The shuttle Atlantis thundered off the launching pad into a stunningly clear evening sky on a mission to continue building the International Space Station. Already delayed for three months by a hailstormthat damaged the foam covering the shuttle's external tank, the launching was unusually smooth.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-5</p>
        <p>Commuters Like Goal, Not Price, of Traffic Plan  Commuters who would be affected the most by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's fast-advancing plan to charge $8 to drive in the most congested parts of Manhattan seem to agree on two points: that something desperately needs to be done about traffic and that they do not want to have to pay for it. B1</p>
        <p>Citywide Tests May Pay  A Harvard economist known for his work on racial inequality in schools is in New York with a big idea: pay students cash for high scores on standardized tests and their performance might improve. And he has captured the attention of Mayor Bloomberg and the chancellor of city schools. B1</p>
        <p>Contractors in Name Only  Gov. Eliot Spitzer is planning to step up enforcement against thousands of companies in New York that illegally misclassify workers as independent contractors to cheat on taxes and skimp on employee benefits, the state labor commissioner said. B1</p>

        <p>CBS Revives 'Jericho'  The resurrection of ''Jericho'' after its cancellation by CBS reflected the efforts of thousands of fans who, because they regularly viewed the show on the Internet or through other nontraditional formats, might not have been counted in the familiar Nielsen television ratings.
