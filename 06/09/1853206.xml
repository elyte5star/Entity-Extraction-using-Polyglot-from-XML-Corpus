        <p>ONE of the best pieces of advice any homeowner will receive when doing renovations or repairs is to use a licensed and insured contractor.</p>
        <p>I have offered this counsel myself. But I confess, I have also been guilty of using workmen who I'm pretty sure were unlicensed and perhaps did not even carry insurance because friends recommended them and because they were good and cheap.</p>

        <p>ONE of the best pieces of advice any homeowner will receive when doing renovations or repairs is to use a licensed and insured contractor.</p>
        <p>I have offered this counsel myself. But I confess, I have also been guilty of using workmen who I'm pretty sure were unlicensed and perhaps did not even carry insurance because friends recommended them and because they were good and cheap.</p>
        <p>I have preferred to play the ostrich with its head in the sand rather than check what kind of responsibility I might carry.</p>
        <p>And no wonder -- because a call to Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, confirmed what I didn't want to know.</p>
        <p>First of all, if the people doing the work in my house are uninsured and they get hurt, I'm responsible.</p>
        <p>''One of the primary reasons you want to hire someone with insurance, is that it's not your problem,'' Ms. Salvatore said.</p>
        <p>We're not talking about someone who occasionally rakes your lawn or fixes a leak, but a worker who will be in your employ for a while. Each state or municipality has different laws for what an employee is and it is a good idea to check what the criteria are.</p>
        <p>If a worker is injured and sues you, then your homeowner's insurances should pay to defend you, ''just as someone who comes to your house and trips on a toy,'' Ms. Salvatore said.</p>
        <p>Homeowner's insurance generally pays $1,000 for injuries; beyond that, the person making the claim has to sue you through the insurance provider to collect more money, and if you lose a lawsuit, you may have to pay out of pocket if you exceed the limits of your policy, she said.</p>
        <p>Another option is to add on no-fault medical insurance, Ms. Salvatore said, which pays an additional $5,000 -- or sometimes more, depending on the policy -- for relatively little additional premium.</p>
        <p>If there is an injury in your home, there is a chance you could lose your insurance</p>
        <p>''Any homeowner who hires someone with no liability is taking their home into their hands,'' said Everett Collier, a certified remodeler and chairman of the board of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry, a trade association. ''There's a good possibility that insurance could cut you off because you didn't do due diligence.''</p>
        <p>To obtain a license in most states, a contractor must show that he has liability insurance or workers' compensation for his employees. And it is not the price of the license -- which may be just a few hundred dollars -- but the cost of the insurance, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars yearly, that helps create the huge underground network of unlicensed workers nationally.</p>
        <p>''For example, if you're hiring a roofer, every dollar he pays to his employee, he has to pay $1 in workers' comp,'' Mr. Collier said. ''In other trades, it may be 30 to 40 cents on every $1.''</p>
        <p>Licensing requirements vary by state and even by city. Some states do not even require contractors to be licensed, while others, particularly California and Florida, have very strict regulations.</p>
        <p>According to the National Association of State Contractors Licensing Agencies, 13 states do not require licensing for residential contractors, although that is changing.</p>
        <p>''More states are moving in that direction,'' said Angie Whitaker, managing director for the agency. ''Consumer boards are getting so many complaints and people are realizing there is no recourse.'' Texas is pushing for some sort of licensing board, she said, and the Oklahoma Legislature introduced rules during its last session to license residential contractors.</p>
        <p>The proposed law was held up in committee, however, said Patricia Schweitzer, deputy administrator with the Construction Industries Board in Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping it will come out of committee next session,'' she said. Her board licenses plumbers, electricians and those who work with heat, air-conditioning and refrigeration, but has no say over contractors.</p>
        <p>''We receive complaints all the time, and there's nothing we can do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>To check on the licensing situation in your state, go to www.nascla.org.</p>
        <p>Many states or municipalities that do require licensing now provide an easy method to research a contractor, often by simply typing in a license number on a Web site, usually through a state or local department of consumer affairs, to find out if any complaints are outstanding. Some states require that the license number be printed on every contract.</p>
        <p>Having a license is, of course, no guarantee that the contractor will do a good job or will even finish a project. But in many cases it offers assurance that the contractor has undergone a criminal check or taken a written exam -- and at least licensing can offer you the possibility of getting some of your money back.</p>
        <p>In New York City, for example, anyone you hire to do a job for under $200 is not required to be licensed. However, those who are licensed and doing work in the five boroughs must either post a performance bond or put $200 into a trust fund every time they renew their license.</p>
        <p>That trust fund, said Dina Roskin, spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, is used as an incentive to get people to use licensed contractors. If a licensed contractor skips out on a job or botches it in some way, the homeowner can file a complaint with the department and collect up to $15,000.</p>
        <p>''Home improvement jobs regularly are the top complaints we receive in this department,'' Ms. Roskin said.</p>
        <p>My friend Claudia, who admitted that she had hired unlicensed workmen to do some jobs, said she was worried about what recourse she had if the work was not up to par.</p>
        <p>''It's always tempting to save money, but I don't really understand the implications of someone not having a license or insurance,'' she said. ''I envision my plumbing bursting after the fact and not being covered because a licensed plumber didn't do the work.''</p>
        <p>My sister, who lives in California, acknowledged that hiring an unlicensed worker ended up costing her some money.</p>
        <p>She used someone who did a good job helping construct an extra room in the backyard. But when it came to running electricity into a bathroom, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
        <p>''He said he could do the electrical work and then he couldn't,'' she said. ''It's great to save money, but then you don't have any clout -- you can't go to the Better Business Bureau and complain. And we spent more money redoing what he did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Collier of the remodeling trade association, who works in California, said there was ''a huge underground economy, from backyard painters to full-blown contractors doing additions.''</p>
        <p>''I've seen it time and time again: horribly botched jobs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In some cases, a homeowner can sue the contractor even if he is unlicensed, but too often such workmen either disappear or have no assets, leaving you with dangling wires and holes in the wall.</p>
        <p>After hearing the horror stories, I think it is time to take my own advice -- next time we have a home renovation project, I'll check the license and insurance of the contractor.</p>
        <p>Then I'll cross my fingers, and hope it all comes in on budget.</p>
        <p>But that is for another column.</p>
