        <p>Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angles announced that he and his wife of 20 years, Corina Villaraigosa, would separate.

The mayor and his wife, a teacher, have two teenage children. Rumors about the Villaraigosas marriage have been swirling for months; the two were rarely seen together, and Mr. Villaraigosa was spotted without his wedding ring, which he attributed to weight loss, denying his marriage was ending.</p>
