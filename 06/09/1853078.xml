      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Vincent A. Cianci Jr., the colorfully controversial former mayor of Providence, R.I., was supposed to go from prison to posh.</p>
        <p>After finishing his five-year federal sentence for corruption, he was to land in the lap of a luxury hotel in Boston, where he would work in sales, marketing and public relations.</p>
        <p>But it seems Mr. Cianci, known as Buddy, just could not stay away from Providence, where he was mayor for more years than anyone else. On Friday, he started work at the 903 Residences, a large condominium complex in Providence, as an assistant to the project manager.</p>
        <p>Joseph Paolino Jr., the owner of the 903 Residences, where Mr. Cianci's daughter lives with her children, said he had helped arrange Mr. Cianci's job at the Boston hotel, Fifteen Beacon. It was supposed to start shortly after he was released from federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J., in late May, and moved to a halfway house in Boston.</p>
        <p>The job at Fifteen Beacon drew tremendous public attention before Mr. Cianci even started, more than even the hotel's management had expected, said George Regan, a hotel spokesman.</p>
        <p>''It had been a distraction to the hotel in recent days,'' Mr. Regan said. ''We've had a lot of famous people stay in the hotel, but we've had nothing compared to this. All day long we had cameras outside, inside, and we have a lot of guests that don't appreciate it.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Regan said the hotel remained committed to hiring Mr. Cianci. But Mr. Paolino said Mr. Cianci, 66, wanted to return to Rhode Island as soon as possible. After a few weeks in the halfway house, he will be allowed to live under home confinement at his nephew's in East Greenwich, R.I., and Mr. Paolino said Mr. Cianci was not thrilled about commuting from there to Boston. On July 28, the home confinement ends and Mr. Cianci will be a free man.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Buddy and he said, 'You know, if I could be in Providence I think that would work out better,' '' said Mr. Paolino, himself a former mayor of Providence, adding that the news media swarm around Fifteen Beacon ''wasn't helpful.''</p>
        <p>The position is also likely to make it easier for Mr. Cianci to abide by federal rules barring him from talking to the news media until his home confinement ends.</p>
        <p>''He's going to be working in an office not open to the public,'' Mr. Regan said. ''It's a big difference. It doesn't have the sex appeal that a hotel like Fifteen Beacon has.''</p>
