        <p>The Georg Büchner Prize, Germany's most prestigious literary award, will be given this year to Martin Mosebach, the German Academy for Language and Literature said yesterday. In its announcement the academy described Mr. Mosebach, 56, as ''a writer who combines stylistic splendor with original storytelling.'' Mr. Mosebach's latest novel, ''The Moon and the Girl'' (''Der Mond und das Mädchen''), is due in August. The Büchner prize, named after the 19th-century author, is worth 40,000 euro (almost $54,000) and has been awarded since 1923. Mr. Mosebach is to receive the prize on Oct. 27 in Darmstadt.</p>
