        <p>The words that shaped Kunal Sah's path to the Scripps National Spelling Bee -- ''determination,'' ''hope,'' ''anguish'' -- were not enough to spell victory.</p>
        <p>Kunal, a 13-year-old boy from Utah who was profiled last month in an article in The New York Times, dreamed that a triumph in the bee, which began in Washington on Wednesday, would cast a spotlight on the plight of his parents. They were sent back to India last year after years of immigration processing and appeals and a rejection of their application for political asylum.</p>
        <p>But Kunal was eliminated along with 178 other teenage spellers in the second round of the competition. He correctly spelled ''hurdle,'' the word he was given in the first oral test, but scored too low on the 25-word written examination.</p>
        <p>He needed at least 15 right answers on a list that included ''Bewusstseinslage'' (a state of consciousness or feeling devoid of sensory components), ''scytale'' (a method of cipher writing used especially by the Spartans) and ''ylem'' (a primordial gas consisting of neutrons). Individual scores were not released by Scripps, and Kunal did not reply to a telephone message left at his home in Utah.</p>
        <p>Evan O'Dorney, 13, of Danville, Calif., won the bee Thursday night, correctly spelling ''serrefine'' (a type of forceps), The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>Kunal, an eighth-grader and an American citizen because he was born in California, lives with an uncle and aunt, helping them run a Ramada Limited Motel in Green River, about three hours from Salt Lake City. This try at the bee was his second and final one. He was eliminated last year in the second round, and as a ninth-grader next year he will be barred by the bee rules from trying again.</p>
        <p>He said then that his plan for the coming year was to get better grades, which suffered after the departure of his parents, Kanhai and Sarita Sah. Down the road he wants to go to Harvard, he said, and become a doctor.</p>
