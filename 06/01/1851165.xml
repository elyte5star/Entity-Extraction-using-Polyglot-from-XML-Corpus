        <p>DUSHKIN--David, 70, of Guilford, Connecticut, died on May 28th, 2007. He was born in Evanston, IL, on June 7th, 1936 and grew up in the neighboring town of Winnetka. His family later moved to Weston, Vermont where his parents founded the Kinhaven Music School. He was educated at the Cambridge School of Weston, Harvard College (cum laude, class of 1958), and received a Masters in Publishing from New York University. He started his career at Random House where he eventually served as the Director of its College Text Book department. After Random House he worked as Publisher of Psychology Today's book division and in 1971 founded the Dushkin Publishing Group, best known for its Annual Editions series. In 1994 it was sold to McGraw Hill. He will be lovingly remembered by his wife Maria, his two sons Peter and Samuel, his sisters Lelah and Nadia, his stepdaughters Vanessa and Melina, and grandchildren Max and Isabel. He brought warmth and character to everything he did and was dearly loved by his family and friends. Memorial services will be held July 7th in Guilford, CT.</p>
