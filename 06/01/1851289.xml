        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re '' 'I Should Be Dead' '' (editorial, May 26):</p>
        <p>I'm not claiming that a governor does not get special treatment. Nonetheless, having spent eight days with our father, Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who was on a ventilator at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J., we witnessed the continuous, top-notch treatment and care of every patient on the trauma unit by nurses and doctors.</p>
        <p>You write, ''Because he is extremely wealthy, his family could call in some of the best medical specialists from New York City.'' My brothers and I had to make some tough medical decisions. A friend from New York University Medical Center asked a few of his colleagues to provide a collegial review. They concurred completely with the Cooper doctors.</p>
        <p>One of our dad's blessings is that he was a 10-minute helicopter ride from Camden. We're grateful to all the staff at Cooper University Hospital for putting him on a healthy road to recovery.</p>
