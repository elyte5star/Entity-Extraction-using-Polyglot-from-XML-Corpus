        <p>A Queens man was charged yesterday with killing an elderly relative with a baseball bat after beating his own companion, prosecutors said. The man, Michael Alexander, 54, was charged with murder, manslaughter and assault, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. The police had been looking for Mr. Alexander since the beating death of Rudolph Campbell, 71, who was married to Mr. Alexander's aunt, in June 2006 at Mr. Alexander's Queens Village home, Mr. Brown said. The fatal beating followed an attack on Mr. Alexander's companion, then 22, during a dispute, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Alexander was found working at a Brooklyn auto body shop after his story was broadcast last month on the television program ''America's Most Wanted,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
