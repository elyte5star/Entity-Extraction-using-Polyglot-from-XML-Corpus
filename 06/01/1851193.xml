        <p>Puerto Rican food, music, dance and cultural exhibitions will fill the city starting this weekend as New York gears up for the 50th annual Puerto Rican Day parade. Though the parade is next Sunday, the organizers have arranged a number of activities as a warm-up. Today a photo exhibition, ''Bomba, Plena y Ponce,'' goes on display at the Manhattan Valley Golden Age Senior Center. Bomba and plena are both forms of music rooted in African tradition that slaves brought to the island. The exhibition will focus on the history of this musical genre, which originated in Ponce, Puerto Rico. ''The parade is dedicated to Ponce,'' said Carlos Velasquez, marketing director for the Puerto Rican Day parade. Tomorrow, a cultural festival on 152nd Street in the Bronx will offer Puerto Rican food and music, including a performance by the salsa singer Choco Orta. And on Sunday, a salsa contest at the Copacabana nightclub will give anyone who pays the $15 admission and takes to the dance floor a shot at dancing on the main stage the day of the parade, which will be televised. About 500 dancing couples are expected and, through a process of elimination they will be judged on the elegance of their steps, their spirit and their ability to stick to custom. (Photo exhibition, through June 10, 135 West 106th Street, Manhattan; free. Street festival, 152nd Street between Jackson and Union Avenues, South Bronx; free. Salsa contest, Sunday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan; $15. For information: nationalpuertoricandayparade.org.)</p>
