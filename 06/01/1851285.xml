      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial welcomes Pres Bush's proposal to extend global AIDS program and to double financing to $30 billion, but says it is nowhere near what is needed to curb widening epidemic; holds that plan remains hampered by restrictions; calls on Group of 8 leaders to follow Bush's lead and raise their own contributions</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An expected less-than-warm welcome at the Group of 8 meeting was also clearly on President Bush's mind this week when he announced an expanded plan to combat AIDS in foreign lands. Even so, that should not obscure the real good that can be done -- both in preventing and treating AIDS and in spurring a wider global fight against H.I.V., the virus that causes it.</p>
        <p>The battle against AIDS has been one of the few shining spots in the Bush administration's otherwise dismal foreign policy. Inspired, perhaps, by the fact that Christian conservatives, his party's base, have embraced AIDS as a cause and by the need to burnish America's image in an increasingly hostile world, Mr. Bush in 2003 launched a five-year, $15 billion program to support treatment, prevention and care in developing countries.</p>

        <p>An expected less-than-warm welcome at the Group of 8 meeting was also clearly on President Bush's mind this week when he announced an expanded plan to combat AIDS in foreign lands. Even so, that should not obscure the real good that can be done -- both in preventing and treating AIDS and in spurring a wider global fight against H.I.V., the virus that causes it.</p>
        <p>The battle against AIDS has been one of the few shining spots in the Bush administration's otherwise dismal foreign policy. Inspired, perhaps, by the fact that Christian conservatives, his party's base, have embraced AIDS as a cause and by the need to burnish America's image in an increasingly hostile world, Mr. Bush in 2003 launched a five-year, $15 billion program to support treatment, prevention and care in developing countries.</p>
        <p>With Congressional add-ons, the total through 2008 will actually exceed $18 billion, by far the largest amount committed by any nation. The program has already provided treatment for some 1.1 million people in 15 countries and prevented millions of new infections, by administration estimates.</p>
        <p>Now, with the first five-year program set to expire next year, the president has proposed a five-year extension with almost twice the financing -- $30 billion over fiscal years 2009 to 2013. The administration estimates that this, when added to the first five-year effort, would bring the total number of people treated to 2.5 million people, prevent 12 million new infections and provide care for more than 12 million people.</p>
        <p>This is a welcome commitment, but nowhere near what's needed to curb the widening epidemic. An estimated 40 million people worldwide are infected with H.I.V., the vast majority in the developing world. Most of the millions already sick have no access to treatment.</p>
        <p>The president's program remains burdened by restrictions requiring that up to 7 percent of the funds be spent on abstinence programs and by Congressional restrictions against providing clean needles to injecting addicts. But the primary need is billions of dollars a year in additional funding. Leaders of the Group of 8 nations ought to follow Mr. Bush's lead and raise their own contributions to this vital global campaign.</p>
