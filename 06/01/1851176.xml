        <p>KUTSCHER--Austin H., D.D.S., Professor Emeritus of Dentistry (in Psychiatry) within the Section of Hospital Dentistry, passed away on May 30, 2007. Dr. Kutscher received his B.A. in 1945 from New York University and the D.D.S. in 1946 from Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery (SDOS). Dr. Kutscher was first appointed as Research Assistant in 1947 at Columbia University SDOS and became Director, New York State Psychiatric Institute Dental Service in 1970. He was a leading figure in the areas of oral medicine and thanatology, and published many articles in clinical oral pathology and pharmacology. His text, Pharmacotherapeutics of Oral Disease, was a standard in its time. He established the Foundation of Thanatology in 1967 which supported research and symposia on the problems surrounding dying and bereavement. Our thoughts and prayers are extended to his wife, Charlotte; sons Harlan, Austin, Jr., and Martin Kutscher; stepsons, Michael, Robert and Richard Goldberg; stepdaughter Carol Maeder; and extended members of the family. A funeral service will be held at the Holcombe-Fisher Funeral Home, 147 Main Street, Flemington, NJ 08822 on Sunday, June 3, at 12:30 pm. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to Flemington Jewish Community Center, 5 Sergeantsville Road, Flemington, NJ 08822 or to the Hunterdon Medical Center Foundation, 2100 Westcott Drive, Flemington, NJ 08822. Ira B. Lamster, D.D.S., M.M.Sc., Dean Columbia University College of Dental Medicine</p>
