        <p>New Hampshire will remain the only state without a law requiring adults to wear seat belts after the State Senate on Thursday rejected a bill mandating their use.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted 8 to 16 against the measure, which would have allowed the authorities to stop a driver solely for not wearing a seat belt.</p>
        <p>But the Senate, which Democrats control 14 to 10, did pass an amendment to another safety bill that sets up a commission to encourage seat belt use and study accident statistics.</p>
        <p>Bills mandating seat belt use have long failed in New Hampshire, where many feel that buckling up is a personal choice, not an act that should be subject to government mandate.</p>
        <p>''The citizens of New Hampshire don't like to be told by anyone else what to do,'' said Senator Robert E. Clegg Jr., a Hudson Republican who voted against the legislation. ''It preserves New Hampshire's way of not succumbing to the bribes of the federal government and New Hampshire's belief that every adult can make his or her own choices in life.''</p>
        <p>The state would have received $3.7 million in federal money for enacting the legislation.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph A. Foster, a Nashua Democrat who voted against the legislation, said he hoped the commission helped increase seat belt use.</p>
        <p>''The correspondence I received from the public showed they weren't ready to take that step,'' of mandating seat belts, Mr. Foster said. ''We need to engage the public in the discussion, and hopefully through the commission we will increase usage.''</p>
        <p>New Hampshire and Wyoming have the lowest rates of seat belt use in the country, 63.5 percent, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Last year 77 percent of fatal crashes in New Hampshire involved occupants who were not wearing seat belts, according to the State Department of Safety.</p>
        <p>''My reaction is one of sadness, because while I don't know their names, I know 10 to 20 additional people will die on the roads of New Hampshire because we haven't summoned the courage to pass mandatory seat belt use,'' Senator Peter Hoe Burling, a Cornish Democrat who supported the legislation, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the bill said buckling up was an issue not only of safety, but also of money, as it was expected that seat belts would have saved the state $48 million in medical costs each year.</p>
        <p>Supporters cannot reintroduce the bill until 2009. ''It's not going away,'' Mr. Burling said.</p>
