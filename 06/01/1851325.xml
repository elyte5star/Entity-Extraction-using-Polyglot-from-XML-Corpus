        <p>Accident Halts London 'Rings'  Performances of the $49.5 million London production of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' with its cast of 50 actors and acrobats, were suspended for two days after the hydraulic stage machinery trapped the leg of Adam Salter, who plays a Ranger, The Times of London reported. A spokeswoman for the show said producers were considering ''modifying'' the stage, which can rise, revolve or lower. Performances are expected to resume with the matinee tomorrow. Thirty minutes into the three-hour show on Wednesday night at the Theater Royal Drury Lane in the West End, members of the audience heard the cry, ''My leg! My leg!,'' and the curtain descended as actors costumed as hobbits hurried to Mr. Salter's aid. He was treated by paramedics before he was taken to a hospital for surgery yesterday.</p>
        <p>New From John Grisham: Pizza and Football  Fans of John Grisham, below, can look forward to a new short novel in the fall. Titled ''Playing for Pizza,'' it deals with the cultural misadventures of a fallen star American quarterback whose agent signs him to a deal with the Parma Panthers in Italy after he can no longer find work in the National Football League. The idea for the novel was born when Mr. Grisham was in Italy researching his last novel, ''The Broker,'' set in Bologna. ''I was pleasantly surprised to find real American football in Italy,'' Mr. Grisham said in a statement, ''and as I dug deeper a novel came together. The research was tough -- food, wine, opera, football, Italian culture -- but someone had to do it.'' Doubleday will publish ''Playing for Pizza'' on Sept. 25 and will issue Mr. Grisham's next legal thriller in the spring.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Pepper at 40  British and American experts will gather at the University of Leeds in northern England on June 19 to weigh the social and cultural impact of the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' Agence France-Presse reported. The gathering is one of many planned events in Britain to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the album, above, issued on June 1, 1967. Tomorrow the BBC will broadcast a documentary on the album featuring cover versions of the Beatles songs by Oasis, the Killers and Kaiser Chiefs, among others. And in Liverpool, where the Beatles were formed, tourist attractions will collaborate on presentations of the band's story and a display of items featured on Peter Blake's ''Sgt. Pepper's'' cover art.</p>
        <p>Home (After 20 Years) For García Márquez  Thousands of people packed the streets of Aracataca, Colombia, when the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel García Márquez, above, returned to his hometown Wednesday for the first time in more than 20 years, Reuters reported. In the place that inspired his most famous novel, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' Mr. García Márquez, 79, dressed in white, signed autographs, posed for photographs and clasped hands with his admirers. ''Long live Gabo'' and ''Gabo, welcome home,'' they cheered as he stepped off the tourist train that carried him to the impoverished town of 53,000. One man said: ''We love him, want to touch him. García Márquez is ours.''</p>
        <p>Old Vic's New Plans  Kevin Spacey, above right, artistic director of the Old Vic Theater in London, will star in a revival of David Mamet's ''Speed-the-Plow'' in the coming season, Playbill.com reported. Other planned productions, besides the previously announced Sam Mendes stagings of ''Hamlet'' and ''The Tempest,'' include an adaptation of the Pedro Almodóvar film ''All About My Mother,'' and a Christmas pantomime of ''Cinderella,'' written by Stephen Fry.  The Peccadillo Theater Company, which specializes in ''forgotten'' American classics, will present what is billed as the first New York City revival of the 1940 Sylvia Regan play, ''Morning Star,'' at the Bank Street Theater from June 28 through July 28. Directed by Peccadillo's artistic director, Dan Wackerman (''Room Service,'' ''Counsellor-at-Law''), the play tells of the hopes and struggles of an immigrant Jewish family on the Lower East Side.  The Roundabout Theater Company will present a new Broadway production of the Terrence McNally comedy ''The Ritz.'' Starring Rosie Perez and Kevin Chamberlin and directed by Joe Mantello, it will open in previews on Sept. 11 at Studio 54.  The run of the rock musical ''Passing Strange'' has been extended for four weeks, through July 1, at the Public Theater.</p>
        <p>New Arts Center in Chicago  The New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien have been chosen to design a $100 million arts center at the University of Chicago, the university is to announce today. The design, still in the conceptual phases, calls for a glass and stone building with several quadrangles, narrow rectilinear windows and a tower described as a ''beacon of light.'' The center -- to be called the Reva and David Logan Center for Creative and Performing Arts, after major donors to the project -- is scheduled for completion in 2011. It will rise on the southern sector of the campus, alongside Frederick Law Olmsted's historic Midway Plaisance Park. The building will feature studios, classrooms and art exhibition space; rehearsal and a black-box theater space for productions and teaching; music practice rooms and performance space; a film vault and screening hall; digital media and editing labs; and media classrooms. University trustees selected Ms. Tsien and Mr. Williams from among six firms in an international design competition.</p>
        <p>Max Gallo Elected To French Academy  The French writer and historian Max Gallo, 75, became an ''immortal'' yesterday when he was elected to the Académie Française, Agence France-Presse reported. The 40 members of the panel, founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, are known as immortals after the official seal, which carries the words ''To immortality.'' They are the custodians of the French language. Mr. Gallo, an author of historical novels and biographies of historical figures, succeeds Jean-François Revel, who died in April at 82.</p>
