        <p>Former Senator John Edwards, a Democratic presidential candidate, told an interviewer on Wednesday that he had read the classified October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate before voting to authorize force in Iraq, but his campaign retracted the statement yesterday.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Edwards said the candidate had ''simply misunderstood the question'' and noted that Mr. Edwards had read only a declassified version of the intelligence report.</p>
        <p>The issue of who had read the full report has bubbled up over the last week with reports that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, had not read it before voting to authorize force in Iraq, even though she and other senators had access to the document. The report was the government's most comprehensive intelligence assessment of Iraq's prewar capability for unconventional weapons.</p>
        <p>The issue surfaced for Mr. Edwards at a forum sponsored by Google when the interviewer, Elliot Schrage, spoke with him about the war.</p>
        <p>''There was this National Intelligence Estimate that was confidential that only -- that you had to have security clearance, or members of the Senate could read,'' Mr. Schrage said. ''Did you have a chance to read that, and was that part of the---- ''</p>
        <p>''I read it. I read it,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''But the idea that somehow we had so much more information -- having the information turned out to be bad, not good.''</p>
        <p>''I know this is intelligence information, but I think it's a very unhealthy thing for the democracy to have -- the notion that we've got people in Washington who are in the know, and we should just trust them to do the right thing without us knowing. Why does America not know?'' Mr. Edwards continued.</p>
        <p>The Edwards spokesman, Mark Kornblau, noted that Mr. Edwards had often said he read intelligence documents that were summarized in the classified report.</p>
        <p>''He simply misunderstood the question,'' Mr. Kornblau said. ''As Senator Edwards has said many times before, he read the declassified version of the N.I.E.,'' not the full report.</p>
        <p>Other presidential candidates, including Senators Clinton and Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, were briefed on the estimate only by aides or administration officials, their advisers say.</p>
        <p>Another presidential candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, sought Thursday to further burnish his national security credentials by announcing his endorsement by Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation appointed by President Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh, who fell out with Mr. Clinton over antiterrorism efforts and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, said in a brief interview that he agreed with Mr. Giuliani's call to stay on the ''offense'' against terrorists. He also echoed Mr. Giuliani's comments that American troops should remain in Iraq until some level of stability was achieved there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani used the endorsement event to announce an ambitious proposal to set up a system to monitor and measure the success of nearly every federal agency. The effort, he said, would closely track what New York City did to monitor the effectiveness of the Police Department through the Compstat program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he met yesterday in Los Angeles with Chief William J. Bratton of the Police Department, who was police commissioner when Mr. Giuliani was mayor of New York and an originator of the Compstat program, to discuss how its basic concepts could be applied to government agencies. The two men had been estranged since Mr. Bratton left the Giuliani administration, and their rapprochement is a signal that Mr. Giuliani is mending fences as he mounts his presidential bid.</p>
        <p>Compstat provided the Police Department with real-time information to detect crime patterns in New York City, and was used to hold police commanders responsible for upticks in crime under their commands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he could envision similar systems for improvements in controlling immigration, fighting terrorism, maintaining domestic security and reducing the size of government.</p>
        <p>''You can take the Compstat principles and apply them to almost any agency in government,'' he said.</p>
