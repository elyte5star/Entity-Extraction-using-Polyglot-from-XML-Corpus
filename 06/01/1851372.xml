        <p>An ex-convict pleaded not guilty yesterday to raping and torturing a Columbia University graduate student in her Hamilton Heights apartment in April. The suspect, Robert A. Williams, 30, was arraigned in State Supreme Court on attempted murder, rape, kidnapping, sexual assault and other charges. Police have said that Mr. Williams, who served eight years in prison for attempted murder, tied the 23-year-old woman to her bed, raped and sodomized her, slit her eyelids and poured bleach and scalding water over her. During his arraignment, Mr. Williams was watched over by about 20 court officers. A prosecutor said he had been found concealing two razor blades on May 21, the day before he was scheduled to be in a lineup.</p>
