        <p>New Jersey Republicans yesterday filed a lawsuit in State Superior Court charging that the Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine, was violating the state's Open Records Act by refusing to release e-mail messages he exchanged with his former companion, the president of a state employees union, during recent contract negotiations. Lawyers for the governor say that the e-mail messages between Mr. Corzine and Carla Katz, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1034, are protected by gubernatorial privilege. Mr. Corzine's lawyers also point out that a state ethics panel has reviewed the messages and concluded that the governor acted appropriately. But Mark Sheridan, a lawyer for the Republican State Committee, said the law required Mr. Corzine to disclose any correspondence that discusses the contract negotiations because they involve state business.</p>
