        <p>Talks between Iran's nuclear negotiator and a top envoy for the European Union ended late Thursday with few signs they were closer to breaking their deadlock over Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
        <p>Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said talks with Ali Larijani, the Iranian negotiator would start again within weeks.</p>
        <p>''We cannot say that there has been a fundamental breakthrough, but what we can say it that we have advanced in many important subjects,'' Mr. Solana told a brief news conference after the four-hour meeting just outside Madrid.</p>
        <p>Exactly one year after the Bush administration offered to reverse almost three decades of American foreign policy and enter European nuclear talks with Iran, Washington and Tehran are holding to the same entrenched positions regarding Iran's uranium enrichment activities. Enriched uranium can be used to produce nuclear fuel, but at much higher grades can be used in nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Iran on Thursday of trying to ''perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon.'' She said the United States and its allies would continue to seek to isolate Iran financially if it did not suspend its enrichment program. She repeated the American ultimatum that the United States would seek action both within and outside the United Nations Security Council if Iran did not accept the offer to talk, along with the strings attached.</p>
        <p>''The question is not why won't we talk to Tehran, but why won't Tehran talk to us,'' Ms. Rice told a news conference at a meeting of international political leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Larijani dismissed the possibility of suspending uranium enrichment on Thursday, telling journalists in Madrid that Tehran had ''abandoned the suspension issue,'' but that it was nonetheless ''quite serious about reaching out for a solution to these problems as soon as possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana acknowledged before the meeting with Mr. Larijani that hopes for a breakthrough were slim. ''It's true that as time goes by, if the situation continues, probably the agreement will be more complicated,'' Mr. Solana said. ''I will try to see if we can pave the way in order to get into formal negotiations.''</p>
        <p>Foreign ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations issued a statement on Wednesday that ''if Iran continues to ignore demands of the Security Council, we will support'' more sanctions at the Security Council, which has already passed two sets of mild sanctions against Iran in the past six months.</p>
        <p>A European official briefed on the talks said Mr. Larijani hinted, ahead of talks in Turkey last month, to diplomats involved in the negotiations that Iran might be prepared to suspend partly its enrichment process as a condition for lifting sanctions and beginning formal talks. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that this nascent proposal was dismissed by European diplomats and then withdrawn by Iran.</p>
        <p>Bush administration officials have refused to talk to Iran about its nuclear program, holding out American participation in Iran's nuclear talks with Europe as a carrot to be given to Iran only if Tehran first agrees to suspend uranium enrichment.</p>
        <p>4th Dual Citizen Arrested, U.S. Says</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) -- Iran has detained a fourth Iranian-American, Ali Shakeri, a California businessman, the State Department said Thursday, calling his arrest part of a ''disturbing pattern'' of harassment of dual citizens.</p>
        <p>''He has also been taken into custody by Iranian officials,'' State Department spokesman Tom Casey told reporters, saying he believed Mr. Shakeri had been detained about 10 days ago and was being held in Tehran's Evin prison.</p>
        <p>He is the fourth Iranian-American to be detained, imprisoned or otherwise barred from leaving Iran recently.</p>
        <p>The other three -- Haleh Esfandiari, a scholar; Kian Tajbakhsh, a social scientist; and Parnaz Azima, a journalist -- have been charged with spying, which could carry the death sentence under Iran's law. The United States has denied that the three are spies and demanded their release.</p>
        <p>Tehran accuses Washington of using intellectuals and others inside the country to undermine the Islamic Republic through what it calls a ''velvet revolution.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Esfandiari's husband, Shaul Bakhash, told a news conference he was worried about the health of his wife, who is also being held in Evin prison. Ms. Esfandiari is the director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.</p>
