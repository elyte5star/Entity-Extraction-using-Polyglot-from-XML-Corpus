        <p>A top Russia expert at the State Department issued an unusually sharp public criticism on Thursday of Moscow's behavior under President Vladimir V. Putin, describing the Kremlin as bullying its neighbors while silencing political opponents and suppressing individual rights at home.</p>
        <p>The comments, approved by the White House, are the latest volley of criticism between Washington and Moscow in recent days. Although the White House said this week that President Bush would play host to Mr. Putin on July 1 at the Bush family compound in Maine, the speech is likely to add tension at a time when the broader dialogue between Washington and Moscow is already taking the most caustic tones since the collapse of communism.</p>
        <p>''We do no one any favors, least of all the Russian people and even their government, by abstaining from speaking out when necessary,'' the Russia expert, David Kramer, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said in a speech Thursday night before the Baltimore Council on Foreign Affairs.</p>
        <p>The speech came a day after Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia accused the United States of fomenting a dangerous new arms race and implicitly threatened to block any effort by the United States and Europe to win broader diplomatic recognition for Kosovo. On Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a scholar of Russian affairs, used a speech in Potsdam, Germany, to describe the American-Russian relationship as one of ''cooperation and competition, of friendship and friction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer's comments appeared to continue a diplomatic tactic by the White House in which the harshest messages are sometimes delivered by lower-ranking officials, to preserve greater latitude for senior policy makers in dealing with their counterparts.</p>
        <p>Several Bush administration officials said they hoped the speech would put Mr. Putin on notice that Mr. Bush is not going to be restrained in his criticism of the Russian government when the two leaders gather for private talks in Maine. At the same time, these officials said, the administration wanted to make clear that the meeting would be an opportunity for the two sides to improve their relations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin are also scheduled to talk next week at the Group of 8 meeting in Germany. The planned visit by Mr. Putin to Kennebunkport, Me., will be the first time in his presidency that Mr. Bush has invited a foreign leader to stay with him at his family compound there.</p>
        <p>In the speech, Mr. Kramer said that recent Kremlin actions ''reflect negative trends on human rights and democracy inside Russia itself,'' and that ''suppression of genuine opposition, abridgement of the right to protest, constriction of civil society and the decline of media freedom are all serious setbacks.''</p>
        <p>''A bumper sticker of our Russia policy,'' Mr. Kramer said, would be to ''cooperate wherever we can; push back whenever we have to.'' An advance copy of the speech was provided by an administration official who wanted to make sure Mr. Kramer's remarks received broad attention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush reached out warmly to Mr. Putin early in his administration, most notably in a meeting at the American president's ranch in Texas. But American officials have become increasingly dissatisfied with Russian conduct, and Mr. Kramer's speech reflected official frustration over Mr. Putin's policies.</p>
        <p>Referring to the planned session in Kennebunkport, Mr. Kramer said: ''Given the tendency of pundits to find a quick explanation, we've already seen the meeting described as everything from a kiss-and-make-up weekend to a trip to the woodshed. In the world in which we really live, it's more likely to be a chance for the two leaders to get some issues on the table, agree on some and disagree on others.''</p>
        <p>He said that while Russia over the past 15 years ''has become more free than at any time in its history'' on issues of internal democratization under Mr. Putin's leadership, ''the backsliding is multifaceted.'' He said examples included restrictions on nongovernmental organizations that have advocated democratization and free elections, as well as ''increasing pressure on Russian journalists.''</p>
        <p>''That Russia is regressing in these areas ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections may not be entirely coincidental,'' he added. ''The Kremlin is bringing its full weight to bear in shaping the environment in favor of its preferred outcome.''</p>
        <p>In foreign policy, Mr. Kramer said, the Kremlin's ''ham-fisted behavior'' included threats to suspend Russia's obligations under the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe -- which, among other things, would require withdrawing forces stationed in independent Moldova -- and its criticisms of democracy initiatives advanced by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer also criticized Russia's decision over the winter to shut down oil and gas to Ukraine and Belarus, a step that he noted had disrupted supplies to European countries downstream.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer did say that the United States wants Russia ''to be a partner in the world,'' and he listed counterterrorism as an arena in which there had been positive ties. He also cited joint efforts to halt the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea, as well as bilateral actions on trade and on investment.</p>
        <p>Addressing the most contentious issue in the relationship today, Mr. Kramer said Russia had no grounds for fearing American proposals to base 10 antimissile interceptors in Poland and missile-tracking radar in the Czech Republic.</p>
        <p>''These systems are intended to shield the United States and its European allies against missile threats from the Middle East,'' he said. ''We have offered ways to work together in confronting this mutual threat from Iran and rogue regimes, but Russia so far prefers unhelpful rhetoric over actual collaboration. The very modest system we have in mind poses no threat whatsoever to Russia.''</p>
        <p>Russia Rejects Kosovo Draft  By The New York Times</p>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS, May 31 -- Russia on Thursday rejected a revised draft of a Security Council resolution advancing a plan for supervised independence of the disputed Serbian province of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, said the revision ''has not changed anything,'' and when asked whether Russia would veto it, he said: ''I do not like use of this word. But you are guessing well what is on my mind.''</p>
        <p>Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, said that the United States would still push for a vote next week and that it was now up to Russia to come up with suggestions for resolving the impasse. He pledged to ''make every effort to accommodate to constructive ideas and suggestions from our Russian colleagues.''</p>
        <p>The resolution supports the plan by the United Nations mediator Martti Ahtisaari that would end United Nations administration of Kosovo in four months and have the European Union take over a supervised transition to independence.</p>
