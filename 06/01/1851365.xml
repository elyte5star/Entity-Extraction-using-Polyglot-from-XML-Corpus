        <p>The Ink feature on Tuesday, about a nonprofit group that collects grease from restaurants at no cost and sells it to a company that converts it into biodiesel fuel, misstated the name of the group. It is RWA Resource Recovery, not RWA Natural Resource Recovery. The article also misstated the reason that the organization does not use biodiesel fuel in the truck that transports the grease. The biodiesel would have to be mixed with the petroleum diesel that the truck now runs on, and the group says it does not yet have the resources to mix the fuels. Vehicles powered by petroleum diesel do not, however, need to be retrofitted to use biodiesel.</p>
