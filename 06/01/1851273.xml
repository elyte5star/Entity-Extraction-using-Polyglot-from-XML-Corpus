        <p>TRENTON, May 31 Â— The New Jersey health commissioner erred in 2005 when he allowed nine hospitals without cardiac surgery units to perform elective angioplasty, the State Supreme Court ruled Thursday.</p>

        <p>The New Jersey health commissioner erred in 2005 when he allowed nine hospitals without cardiac surgery units to perform elective angioplasty, the State Supreme Court ruled Thursday.</p>
        <p>The commissioner of health and senior services, Dr. Fred M. Jacobs, allowed the hospitals to conduct elective angioplasty, a procedure that cleans the arteries, as part of a three-year multistate demonstration project run by a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, essentially bypassing the normal vetting and public discussion of rule changes.</p>
        <p>In its 5-to-0 ruling, the court said that ''although authorized, the regulation violates fundamental principles relating to the regulatory process.''</p>
        <p>The ruling added, however, that it would be unjust to require the hospitals to comply immediately and gave them until Dec. 1 to stop offering the procedure.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Dr. Jacobs, Tom Slater, said that department officials were reviewing the ruling and would have no comment.</p>
        <p>The court's ruling grew out of a suit filed by three hospitals in southern New Jersey that at the time were among the only ones in their region allowed to perform angioplasty under the rules requiring that they have a cardiac surgery unit on site. They were trying to block a competitor, Virtua West Jersey Hospital in Marlton, from performing the procedure.</p>
        <p>A group of cardiologists, many affiliated with hospitals already licensed to perform the procedure, were said to have seen the commissioner's action as an attempt by community hospitals to get a share of a growing, lucrative market. The three hospitals that sued are Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center and Cooper University Hospital, both in Camden, and Deborah Heart and Lung Center in Browns Mills.</p>
        <p>The ruling observed that since 1976 the rate of complications with angioplasty, in which a balloon or metal stent is put into blocked coronary arteries, had dropped to 0.2 percent of a year's cases from 4 percent. Nevertheless, the state's regulations continued to require a cardiac surgery unit at the site in the event of complications while the procedure was being performed.</p>
        <p>''The approval of programs inconsistent with detailed regulations that would otherwise prohibit them cannot stand,'' the ruling said.</p>
        <p>Angioplasty became popular in the 1980s as a less invasive approach for coronary blockages than open heart surgery to construct bypasses around them. Stents improved the procedure by combating the tendency of many vessels to reclose quickly after angioplasty.</p>
        <p>But some recent studies have suggested that drug therapy on clogged and blocked coronary arteries may be more effective than the currently wide use of drug-coated stents in angioplasty. A study published in December in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that doctors ''overused'' the stents, which cost up to $15,000 to implant.</p>
