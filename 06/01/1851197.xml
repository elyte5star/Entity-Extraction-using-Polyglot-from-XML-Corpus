        <p>This festival is a bit of a grab bag: The only thing the 50 features and shorts have in common is that they've recently been the subject of preservation work by archives, studios or distributors somewhere in the world. But it's a bag full of fascinating curiosities. A few of the films, like tonight's opening feature, John Cassavetes's ''Faces,'' are relatively familiar. But where else will you see ''Cabiria'' (1914), left, an epic Italian silent set in the Punic Wars and made two years before ''Intolerance''? (It shows at 2 p.m. tomorrow.) Not to mention Jean Renoir's first solo film, ''La Fille de l'Eau'' (1925), or ''Terje Vigen'' (''A Man There Was,'' 1917), a silent film, based on an Ibsen poem, by the great Swedish director Victor Sjostrom, or a full-length, color-tinted print of the King Vidor masterpiece ''The Big Parade'' (1925). Choices from (somewhat) more recent years include Andy Warhol's ''Chelsea Girls'' (1966), properly split-screened; the rarely seen, unusually experimental Satyajit Ray film ''Nayak'' (''The Hero,'' 1966); and the terrific thriller ''Pretty Poison'' (1968) with Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld. (Through June 18, Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org; $10.)</p>
