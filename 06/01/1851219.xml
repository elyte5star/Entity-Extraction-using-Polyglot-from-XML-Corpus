        <p>WHAT do Brad Pitt, Barack Obama and Garrison Keillor have in common? At some time in their lives, they've all sung in choirs. An estimated 23 million American adults are doing so now, according to a survey by Chorus America, an association of vocal ensembles. With numbers like that, it's not hard to understand why so many people love choral music. Whether experienced from within the chorus or from the audience outside, the unique sound of music made by groups of people using their own voices has a universal appeal.</p>
        <p>At choral festivals this spring and summer, audiences will hear classic and modern choral works, often directed by renowned conductors, in settings ranging from a lavish California performance hall to a hockey rink in Massachusetts. And some music lovers will also be able to mingle with singers or do some singing themselves.</p>
        <p>Michael Taint of Dayton, Ohio, who will be in a choir in July at the most venerable American choral event, the Berkshire Choral Festival in Sheffield, Mass., said he began singing at 41 during what he called a midlife crisis. ''I already had a motorcycle and a divorce,'' he said. The singing turned out to be satisfying: this year he will be back at the festival for the ninth time. The festival operates as a singing camp for adults (registration for participants this year closed in January). It has also spread beyond the Berkshires, with programs as far afield this year as Canterbury, England, and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
        <p>In Massachusetts, audiences expected to number about 700 at a time will listen to seasoned singers in the Sheffield hockey rink -- strains of harmony resounding where the winter sounds run to raucous cheering and body checks. In the Berkshire offshoot in Vancouver, the CBC Radio Orchestra will accompany about 200 singers in Verdi's ''Requiem'' at the 1,100-seat Chan Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
        <p>In San Luis Obispo, Calif., audiences will become judges at the first California International Choral Festival, and ''people's choice'' awards will be given along with the decisions of a panel of judges using tuning devices to check that the singers are on key. The festival performances will be in the $30 million Christopher Cohan Performing Arts Center, with choirs from countries including Uganda, the Philippines and Finland.</p>
        <p>The Finger Lakes Choral Festival, which will take place in Rochester in late July, began five years ago as a summer outlet for choristers. More than 200 singers, mainly from upstate New York, will perform one of the most popular choral works of the 20th century, ''Carmina Burana'' by Carl Orff.</p>
        <p>The Vermont International Choral Festival, with headquarters at the Trapp family lodge in Stowe, will feature seven participating choirs, including one from Trinidad and Tobago. Performances will take place at churches and community centers, but the main event will be a gathering of all the choirs for a program of spirituals and traditional folk songs conducted by the composer and director Robert De Cormier.</p>
        <p>''Standing in 'Sound of Music' land and hearing the sounds of hundreds of voices is a great feeling of pride and connection,'' said Linda Radtke, a member of Mr. De Cormier's professional choir who has sung in the festival three times. ''You can have that in a cathedral in England, but here it's a feeling of awe in the beauty of the landscape and the music.''</p>
        <p>In Ontario, Canada, the Niagara International Music Festival, organized by Don Harper, who puts together many choral events, will have its 13th season this year with performances in the communities of Niagara Falls, St. Catharines and Grimsby. In Niagara Falls, choirs will sing in a church a few minutes' drive from the falls themselves, where tourists gather from around the world. The location melds perfectly with Mr. Harper's philosophy about singing: he sees choral music as something that brings people together -- not only for enjoyment, but even as a peacemaker.</p>
        <p>''When you're singing,'' he said, ''you're not throwing bombs or sticks.''</p>
