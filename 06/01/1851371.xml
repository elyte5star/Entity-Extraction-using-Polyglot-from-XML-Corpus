        <p>A man was arrested yesterday in connection with eight robberies of taxi drivers since May 17, the police said, and a realistic-looking toy pistol, which they believe he used to carry them out, was recovered. At a news conference, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly identified the man as Earl Bradley Evans, 36. He was arrested when he returned to the building where he lived, at 231 Vernon Avenue in Brooklyn, Mr. Kelly said, by officers who had been staking it out. Mr. Kelly declined to say what led detectives to Mr. Evans, who was carrying a Tennessee driver's license, and said the charges against him had not been determined. But Mr. Kelly said he chose to announce the arrest yesterday to allay taxi drivers' fears that a serial robber armed with a real gun was on the loose.</p>
