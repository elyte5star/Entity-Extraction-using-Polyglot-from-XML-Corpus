        <p>Former President Frederick Chiluba is well enough to stand trial on corruption charges despite being hospitalized last week after collapsing at his home with an acute heart ailment, a judge ruled in the capital, Lusaka. Mr. Chiluba, 64, was convicted last month by a London court of embezzling $46 million while serving as president from 1991 to 2002. Zambian prosecutors have charged him with stealing nearly $500,000 during his years in office. His trial has been delayed since May 2006 because of health concerns. A Zambian magistrate, Jones Chinyama, said that Mr. Chiluba could be tried either via a video link from his home or by moving court proceedings there.</p>
