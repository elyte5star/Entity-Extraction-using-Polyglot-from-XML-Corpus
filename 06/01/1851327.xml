        <p>A familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity, Davis Guggenheim's ''Gracie'' depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school soccer team. Yet the movie's follow-your-heart simplicity masks deeper concerns; like the recent ''Flicka,'' this perceptive family drama is really about a daughter's struggle for her father's attention.</p>
        <p>The sole girl in a soccer-mad family, Grace Bowen (a wonderful Carly Schroeder), 15, is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked. Her mother (Elisabeth Shue) is overprotective, and her father (Dermot Mulroney) -- an ex-player freighted with his own childhood issues -- is only interested in training his three sons. When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer.</p>
        <p>Set in New Jersey in 1978 and based on events in Ms. Shue's life, ''Gracie'' connects the adversity-drama dots -- the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter -- with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley's refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens.</p>
        <p>JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</p>
        <p>''Gracie'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Characters fumble the ball and fumble with one another.</p>
