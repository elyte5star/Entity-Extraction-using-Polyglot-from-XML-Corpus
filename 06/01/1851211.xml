      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>8 P.M. (Travel Channel) MOST HAUNTED LIVE USA -- Night-vision camera. Check. Thermal-imaging device. Check. Courage. Um, check. Karl Beattie, Yvette Fielding and David Wells (from left, above) and the rest of the spirit-sleuthing team from the British show ''Most Haunted Live'' travel to the United States to investigate paranormal activity at Eastern State Penitentiary, a famously haunted prison in Philadelphia, in this live seven-hour special. Viewers can log onto travelchannel.com to watch supplemental action via Web cams as the team ventures into places off-limits to the public to dredge up things that go bump in the night.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Discovery) EDGE OF EXISTENCE -- The adventurer Donal MacIntyre braves the Arabian Desert to live with Bedouin nomads -- and wonders why on earth they don't move into town -- in this series premiere.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) TV's FUNNIEST MOMENTS -- Brad Garrett is host of this two-hour special from the Museum of Television &amp; Radio, which counts down 30 of the most humorous scenes from sitcoms and variety, late-night and sketch comedy shows. Some obvious choices: ''Seinfeld,'' ''The Honeymooners,'' ''I Love Lucy'' and ''All in the Family.''</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CMT) BORN COUNTRY -- This new documentary series about country proclivities tees off with a look at young mothers, right, whose shameless love of karaoke causes equal parts pride, joy, heartache and embarrassment, especially for the listeners.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) BILL MOYERS JOURNAL -- Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator from Nebraska, talks about why he supported the war in Iraq and why he believes that having American forces there is necessary. The journalist Christian Parenti, back from the front line in Afghanistan, discusses the influence of warlords there and the resurgence of the Taliban.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (IFC) BUBBA HO-TEP (2002). One man (Bruce Campbell) says he's Elvis, still alive after the death of an impersonator. Another (Ossie Davis) claims to be President John F. Kennedy, turned black through a surgical procedure after a foiled assassination attempt. Both are alive and kicking, and they're battling an Egyptian mummy out for blood in their nursing home.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR -- Lisa K., a 28-year-old middle school teacher, still dresses in the clothes she wore when she was her students' age. Stacy and Clinton give her some remedial wardrobe lessons.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (IFC) THE HENRY ROLLINS SHOW -- Mr. Rollins riffs on how the nation's leaders took advantage of the public's ignorance about the Middle East before switching gears to wonder about the animal world's most skittish member, the impala. William Shatner, a guest, remembers the director Roger Corman. And the band Peeping Tom performs ''Mojo.''</p>
