        <p>Pressure to slim General Electric's corporate portfolio at home has not stopped Jeffrey R. Immelt's aggressive plans for expanding in emerging markets.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, told executives here that India had ''never offered us more potential than it does today.''</p>
        <p>G.E. plans to participate in the country's ''massive focus'' on energy, he said, and will create a fund for infrastructure that could reach $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''This is the era of the developing world and of emerging markets,'' Mr. Immelt said. As the United States economy cools, G.E. and other large multinational companies are shifting their focus to faster-growth parts of the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Immelt's latest trip to India comes as the country's economy hit a new high. Figures released on Thursday showed that India's gross domestic product grew by 9.4 percent in the year ended in March. Indian officials say they expect growth to continue above 9 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''If we can grow at the same pace as the Indian economy, we can be a great company,'' Mr. Immelt said.</p>
        <p>Last year, G.E. executives said that they planned to make India a major market and that revenue from India would more than quadruple, to $8 billion by 2010. Assets in India will also reach $8 billion by 2010, the company said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Immelt said Thursday that those goals were in sight: revenue in India in 2007 should be $3 billion, out of $175 billion at G.E., and by 2008 should reach $4 billion. G.E. should ''blow right through'' the target of $8 billion in Indian assets by 2010, he said.</p>
        <p>This year, G.E. will earn more revenue outside of the United States than in it. The company said in April that first-quarter profit rose 2 percent, in part because of a focus on selling goods and consumer services in Asia and the Middle East. Revenue in developing markets was up 14 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Some analysts, notably Jeffrey Sprague of Citigroup, have suggested that G.E. spin off units, including NBC Universal and GE Money, to streamline the company and improve its stock performance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Immelt did not address asset sales Thursday. Instead, he said the company would continue to focus on several ''macro themes,'' including emerging markets.</p>
        <p>A worldwide demand for infrastructure is ''a stunning long-term trend,'' Mr. Immelt said, and could require $4 trillion in overall global investment over the next eight years. Other macro themes include environmental technologies and opportunities created by changing demographics, like the rapidly growing need for health care.</p>
        <p>The visit by Mr. Immelt comes as United States and Indian officials are in the last stages of negotiating a deal to share civilian nuclear technology. The plan has been stalled several times, though an agreement could be struck this weekend when R. Nicholas Burns, an under secretary of state, comes to New Delhi for fresh talks.</p>
        <p>Nuclear plant manufacturers, including G.E. and Westinghouse, are expected to be the chief beneficiaries of any deal, and G.E. has been lobbying both governments to agree to the plan.</p>
        <p>''India wants to do this, and the United States wants to do it,'' said Scott R. Bayman, president and chief executive of GE India, after Mr. Immelt's speech. ''It makes so much sense. We'll get it resolved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Immelt said he intended ''ultimately to be a participant in the nuclear industry here.''</p>
        <p>G.E.'s presence in India dates back more than a century, and the company's former chief executive John F. Welch Jr. is largely credited with promoting India as an outsourcing center. GE Money is one of India's largest credit card lenders through a partnership with the State Bank of India, and the company counts India's largest companies among its customers.</p>
        <p>Over the last 12 months, G.E. signed deals to finance a power plant for a cement company and supply Air India with environmentally friendly engines. It also said it planned to invest $2 billion in Indian real estate and about $250 million in infrastructure and health care projects in India.</p>
        <p>Despite the activity, India's effect on G.E.'s revenue stream is still minimal. India provided less than 2 percent of G.E.'s overall revenue last year, at $1.9 billion. Even so, that represented a jump of 90 percent over 2005.</p>
        <p>G.E. expects to add 4,000 more employees in India over the next two years, bringing its total work force in the country to 17,000.</p>
