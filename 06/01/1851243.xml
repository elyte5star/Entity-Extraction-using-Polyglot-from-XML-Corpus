        <p>THE latest in a long line of New York State insurance superintendents -- there were 38 before him, one of whom, Neil D. Levin, went on to run the Port Authority and perished at ground zero -- Eric R. Dinallo is blessed with the sustainable energy peculiar to public servants genuinely convinced of their indispensability to the public good.</p>
        <p>Harbor any negative thoughts about the insurance industry? Mr. Dinallo will cure them. He is extremely persuasive when on message, which apparently is always. ''Insurance is one of the greatest modern inventions of humankind,'' he asserts, with a straight face. ''Insurance companies make modern risk-taking, which is what capitalism is based in, possible.''</p>
        <p>On this busy Tuesday, he was named Gov. Eliot Spitzer's choice for chairman of the Commission to Modernize the Regulation of Financial Services. The state must, Mr. Dinallo says, hew to a 21st-century template or risk its status as a global financial services kingpin.</p>
        <p>He is unnervingly peppy despite professing to be exhausted after a challenging month that included a resolution of the protracted legal battle over the insurance claims at ground zero, which had crippled construction at the site. The stalemate had gnawed at him whenever he locked eyes with Mr. Levin's portrait in the conference room.</p>
        <p>''I was sort of shocked and alarmed that it was still going on,'' he says. ''It was a tarnish on the insurance industry, a tarnish on the downtown real estate market, and a tarnish on this agency. The agency's position is that it didn't want the lack of a settlement at ground zero to be an overhang on this administration.''</p>
        <p>After eight weeks of heated negotiations, he helped broker a solution. On May 23, the Port Authority and Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who leased the World Trade Center complex, reached a $2 billion settlement with the insurers. ''Now I can look him in the eye,'' he says of Mr. Levin's photo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinallo exudes sagacity for a man of 43. Even his memos to his staff extol the momentousness of insurance: ''Insurance is the lifeblood that permits prudent risk taking in industry, financial services, professions, and in each of our personal lives.'' Striking stuff.</p>
        <p>''It's great to wake up every day and feel like you only have one client: the public good,'' Mr. Dinallo adds. ''It's actually liberating.'' Not that he felt uninspired during a lucrative stint in the private realm. He spent three years as a managing director of regulatory affairs for Morgan Stanley and one as general counsel to Willis Group Holdings, the world's third-largest insurance broker, after finding his niche as a prosecutor working for Mr. Spitzer when the governor was attorney general. Securities fraud was his specialty. Still is, in a sense. His department handles 70,000 complaints each year from people with insurance-related gripes.</p>
        <p>GETTING back to business on the public's behalf, and being greenlighted to modernize, even revolutionize, his bureau's stamp on everything from health insurance (he favors universal) to workers' compensation to ''principles rather than rules-based'' regulatory standards for the financial services industry (''otherwise, all we're doing is writing speeding tickets''), is a thrilling proposition for this do-gooder.</p>
        <p>For comic relief, Mr. Dinallo is a comic-book aficionado. Anybody who painstakingly positions action-hero statuettes of Flash Gordon and Wonder Woman alongside his antique chess set is a likely possessor of the overachiever gene.</p>
        <p>He refreshes himself with bottled water and a handful of Hershey's Kisses and keeps on talking about insurance. In the educated opinion of Mr. Dinallo, prematurely gray in a profuse way and a year-round advocate of pink ties, insurance is neither a downer nor a yawner and decidedly not a necessary evil. Just necessary.</p>
        <p>They called him ''the Hammer'' in his prosecutorial heyday as chief of the investment protection bureau in the attorney general's office (he led the investigations into conflicts of interest in the financial services industry). He considers Mr. Spitzer a mentor and likeminded contemporary: they are both result-driven.</p>
        <p>''Doing nothing is a choice,'' he says. ''Doing nothing is the worst.''</p>
        <p>He has yet to earn a nickname in his latest incarnation, which is more regulatory than adversarial. But if the commentary penned by Mr. Spitzer on a photograph from their A.G. Squad era is any indication, he will probably wind up with a moniker not much different from his old one. The Spitzer inscription reads, in part, ''In your tradition we are still trying to cause havoc and spread reform.''</p>
        <p>His highly personalized office in the financial district is decorated not with typical governmental fare -- plaques, portraiture, and sequoia-size furniture -- but with Brno and Breuer chairs scavenged from Manhattan's finer curbsides (his motto: heavy garbage tends to be good garbage) and Pollock-esque oil paintings he drizzled into creation himself while at Vassar, where he majored in philosophy, and the Duke University School of Public Policy.</p>
        <p>He earned his law degree at New York University in 1990 and joined Paul, Weiss as a litigation associate in 1991. Since then, work has trumped artwork, though he certainly is not shy about using his office as a gallery for a one-man retrospective.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinallo traces his artsy bent to his parents. His mother studied print-making, and his father moved the family from Manhattan to Santa Monica, Calif., when Mr. Dinallo was 9, the better to pursue a career writing television scripts for series like ''Quincy'' and ''The Six Million Dollar Man.'' Mr. Dinallo lives in Manhattan with his wife, Priscilla Almodovar, head of the state's Housing Finance Agency, and their two children. And yes, his insurance premiums are all paid up. Nothing like setting a good example.</p>
