        <p>Anthony Famiglietti may be the fastest and most versatile distance runner the New York City area has ever produced. Tomorrow, he will run 5,000 meters at the Reebok Grand Prix on Randalls Island.</p>
        <p>For the past few years, he has been coached by phone. He does not keep a training log. He writes his workouts on his hand. He does not think about the grueling intervals until he runs them. Afterward, he deletes his split times from his watch.</p>
        <p>''When I'm done, there's nothing in the memory,'' he said. ''It's all a process of moving forward.''</p>
        <p>In lighter moments, he has sported a Mohawk while racing. In a more sobering one, he earned a silver medal in steeplechase at the 2001 United States Nationals while running with his best friend's cremated ashes in his shoes. It was ''an unbelievable gesture,'' he said, for his friend's father to put them there. ''It was kinda spooky, though. The whole time, I was worried about landing in the water.''</p>
        <p>Yet none of this is what his fellow world-class athletes find most unusual about Famiglietti. It is that Famiglietti, a 2004 Olympian in the steeplechase, lives and trains in Manhattan full time. Alone.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I could do it,'' said Bernard Lagat, a two-time Olympic medalist at 1,500 meters and the 2006 United States national champion at 5,000 meters.</p>
        <p>''There's no place else I'd rather be,'' said the 28-year-old Famiglietti, who grew up on Long Island in Medford, N.Y., and competed for Appalachian State and Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''Central Park is my office,'' he said. ''I'm there every day, sometimes twice. I'll be working hard, come around a corner and see a row of skyscrapers overlooking the park. My dad used to take me up those buildings before they had walls. He's been a steamfitter in New York City for 40 years. I know how hard he worked to build Manhattan. I'll see that view and it makes me want to work that much harder.''</p>
        <p>Famiglietti does his high-intensity workouts on one of two tracks. When all goes well, he is at Icahn Stadium, the $42 million facility on Randalls Island, the site of tomorrow's meet.</p>
        <p>On Memorial Day, with the gate locked, there he was alone for his last hard workout. On his way home to East 89th Street, while Famiglietti was stopped near the pedestrian bridge connecting Wards Island to East Harlem, a man in sunglasses nearly walked off with his neon green racing flats.</p>
        <p>The 5-foot-9, 130-pound Famiglietti barely shrugged. ''It's not like I couldn't catch him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When forced to train elsewhere, Famiglietti settles for the public track on the Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>''When Fam decided to go back to the City two or three years ago, I thought he was crazy,'' said Todd Williams, a two-time Olympian at 10,000 meters and fellow Tennessee alumnus. ''My advice was: 'Don't do it,' but he's proven me way wrong.''</p>
        <p>In March, Famiglietti won the national 8-kilometer championship in Central Park. In April, he ran the fastest 5,000 meters by an American on United States soil (13 minutes 11.93 seconds) at the Mt. SAC Relays -- a time that would have won any previous national championship. In May, he won the 3,000-meter race at the Adidas Track Classic in Carson, Calif., in 7:41.27, his best time.</p>
        <p>Last year, Famiglietti was ranked among the top five Americans in three events from 1,500 to 10,000 meters, including the 300-meter steeplechase.</p>
        <p>''Once he tries steeplechase again, you'll probably see something special,'' said George Watts, who has coached Tennessee's distance runners for 22 years. The United States has never won a world championship medal in men's steeplechase, and the last Olympic medal was Brian Diemer's bronze at the 1984 Games.</p>
        <p>Now that he has choices, Famiglietti has not determined what he might run in Beijing in 14 months if he makes the American Olympic team. He hinted that he may return to steeplechase at the nationals, June 20-24 in Indianapolis, and if it goes well, then perhaps again at the world championships in Osaka, Japan, Aug. 25 to Sept. 2.</p>
        <p>Training for the steeplechase in New York City would be harder than his current regimen. ''They don't keep hurdles out on the track here,'' he said.</p>
