        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Zackary Adler  93 minutes</p>
        <p>Sweetness and whimsy fill the screen to capacity in ''I'm Reed Fish,'' a rural coming-of-age tale that's so laid-back that its cast is almost horizontal. Set in the fictional town of Mud Meadows -- a cross between Stars Hollow and Lake Wobegon -- this movie is about a guy who makes a movie about his life. Moreover, it was written by the real Mr. Fish, drawing from events in his own life. Try to stay with me now.</p>

        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Zackary Adler  93 minutes</p>
        <p>Sweetness and whimsy fill the screen to capacity in ''I'm Reed Fish,'' a rural coming-of-age tale that's so laid-back that its cast is almost horizontal. Set in the fictional town of Mud Meadows -- a cross between Stars Hollow and Lake Wobegon -- this movie is about a guy who makes a movie about his life. Moreover, it was written by the real Mr. Fish, drawing from events in his own life. Try to stay with me now.</p>
        <p>Our small-town hero (played by Jay Baruchel) is a gangly young man at that difficult stage between about-to-be-married and calling-it-off. Shuffling back and forth between his serene fianc√©e (Alexis Bledel) and a sunny singer-songwriter (Schuyler Fisk), Reed can barely concentrate on his daily radio show. Meanwhile his folksy listeners are irritated by his escalating distraction. Who will help them with their shrubbery regulations?</p>
        <p>Filled with painfully awkward men with painfully bad haircuts, ''I'm Reed Fish'' is directed by Zackary Adler, exhibiting less energy than a sloth on Seconal. As the young man fearful of living an old man's life, Mr. Baruchel recalls John Turturro in his Barton Fink incarnation: all bones and aching eyes. Yet not even Mr. Fink would dither so gracelessly between the girl in the hand and the one he can't get out of his head.</p>
        <p>JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</p>
        <p>''I'm Reed Fish'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild language and the bizarre offspring of a zebra and a horse.</p>
