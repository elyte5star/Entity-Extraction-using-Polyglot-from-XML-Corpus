        <p>Talks intended to restart stalled negotiations on a landmark nuclear pact between India and the United States began here on Thursday amid disagreement over India's right to continue testing nuclear weapons and process spent fuel.</p>
        <p>When the nuclear deal was first announced almost two years ago, it was seen as symbolic of a new strategic partnership between India and the United States. But negotiations over the details have made only slow progress as both countries have shied away from making politically delicate concessions.</p>
        <p>R. Nicholas Burns, the United States under secretary of state for political affairs, arrived in New Delhi on Thursday and went directly into meetings with Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon in an attempt to broker a compromise before an expected meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the Group of 8 summit meeting in Germany next week.</p>
        <p>Once finalized, the deal would overturn 30 years of American sanctions on the sale of civilian nuclear technology -- fuel and reactors -- to India. It would give India the status of a ''responsible'' nuclear power, even though it has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>
        <p>Before the talks, American officials said they were optimistic that solutions could be found. ''There is considerable work to be done on what is a very technical and detailed agreement,'' David C. Mulford, the United States ambassador to India, said in a statement. ''We want to finish as soon as we can and both sides are positive we can do this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns, who last month expressed frustration at the slow pace of the talks, said this week in Washington that the deal would ''continue to require hard work and difficult compromises to reach completion.'' But he added, ''Despite some difficulties of late, I believe we will reach the mountaintop and realize the enormous promise of this breakthrough agreement.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the deal in the United States are concerned that the longer the negotiations continue, the less time there will be to push the deal through before the Bush administration draws to a close.</p>
        <p>For Indian officials, the main obstacle to an agreement is an American requirement that a voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons be converted into a legally binding commitment, meaning that the United States could withdraw nuclear fuel supplies if India decided to test another nuclear weapon.</p>
        <p>India's unilateral commitment not to test nuclear weapons is ''obviously contingent on existing conditions continuing,'' M. R. Srinivasan, a former chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission, wrote in the newspaper The Hindu on Thursday. If ''China, Pakistan or another country were to test, then clearly India cannot be expected to continue its moratorium.''</p>
