        <p>''Fate's Imagination,'' a mix of politics, sex, comedy and drama receiving its world premiere at the Players Theater, lets you know early on that it's a gratingly uneven piece of work. That ends up being a good thing, because it frees you not to view the play as a serious piece of theater and instead sit back and enjoy its strengths: a couple of tasty plot twists and some very funny lines.</p>
        <p>Brock (Jed Orlemann) is the 20-something son of a United States senator from New York named Susan (Donna Mitchell), who is running for president. Late at night on a New York street he is propositioned by Lilah (Elizabeth Norment), a woman at least twice his age, and some May-December sex soon follows.</p>

        <p>''Fate's Imagination,'' a mix of politics, sex, comedy and drama receiving its world premiere at the Players Theater, lets you know early on that it's a gratingly uneven piece of work. That ends up being a good thing, because it frees you not to view the play as a serious piece of theater and instead sit back and enjoy its strengths: a couple of tasty plot twists and some very funny lines.</p>
        <p>Brock (Jed Orlemann) is the 20-something son of a United States senator from New York named Susan (Donna Mitchell), who is running for president. Late at night on a New York street he is propositioned by Lilah (Elizabeth Norment), a woman at least twice his age, and some May-December sex soon follows.</p>
        <p>The playwright, Randall David Cook, doesn't have much light to shed on what drives such a liaison, but he's really just using the titillation as cover for some topical antiwar commentary. The two themes mesh clumsily, and the actors don't really convince you of any of it: Mr. Orlemann's perpetual smirk plus Ms. Norment's world-weariness does not equal sparks, and Ms. Mitchell isn't forceful enough to evoke Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cook has an ear for humor that compensates for the clunkiness, and if the actors can't sell his characters, they certainly sell his jokes. Ms. Mitchell may not have a politician's presence worthy of Mrs. Clinton, but she's way funnier, thanks to a deft deadpan style. Her delivery of a sly dig at the Upper East Side is almost worth the price of admission by itself.</p>
        <p>The show, produced by Gotham Stage Company and directed by Hayley Finn, moves quickly at an intermissionless 90 minutes. And if Mr. Cook has assembled more of a grab bag than a play -- blogging! campaigning! needless nudity! -- well, there's pleasure in simple surprises.</p>
        <p>''Fate's Imagination'' continues through June 17 at the Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 352-3101.</p>
