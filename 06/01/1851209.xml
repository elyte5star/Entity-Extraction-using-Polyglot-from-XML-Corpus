        <p>The audience that packed Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night was drawn by the chance to hear two of opera's most glamorous and charismatic stars: the soprano Anna Netrebko and the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, performing arias and duets with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, Asher Fisch conducting. But the program also offered a lesson in the continuing importance of national singing styles.</p>
        <p>As the world gets smaller, distinctions between national traditions in music, especially in opera, have tended to blur. Though Mr. Hvorostovsky and Ms. Netrebko have built their reputations singing a wide range of repertory, on this occasion, when these two exciting Russian artists switched from French and Italian works to music in their native language, there was a palpable leap in the intensity, authority and beauty of their performances.</p>
        <p>This was especially true of their last offering, the extended final scene of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' with Ms. Netrebko's lushly sung and emotionally volatile Tatyana, and Mr. Hvorostovsky's impassioned and psychologically revealing Onegin. Who needed costumes and scenery?</p>
        <p>Given the ecstatic ovations of the audience, I seemed to be in the minority with my equivocal reactions to the first selections performed. As Ms. Netrebko sang ''Je veux vivre,'' the waltzing, coquettish aria from Act I of Gounod's ''Roméo et Juliette,'' the sheer, smoky beauty of her rich and vibrant voice, with its gleaming top notes, was impossible to deny. Still, her execution of runs was hesitant, her pitch sometimes unstable and her French diction mushy.</p>
        <p>She seemed more confident in Lucia's entrance aria and cabaletta from Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' but her coloratura passagework was rough and inelegant at times. She made compellingly clear, though, that even as we meet her, Lucia is already a mentally fragile young woman haunted by visions.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Hvorostovsky brought wonderful swagger to his singing of the ''Toreador Song'' from Bizet's ''Carmen,'' the music sits low for his voice; his sound was gravelly and his diction indistinct.</p>
        <p>He gave an enticing hint of the kind of menacing yet elegantly conniving Iago he might be in his performance of the ''Credo'' from Verdi's ''Otello,'' though here too he sounded not fully confident in the music. He and Ms. Netrebko seemed more instinctive during their intense and tender account of the love scene between Nedda and Silvio from Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci.''</p>
        <p>The character, texture and colorings of Mr. Hvorostovsky's voice were noticeably more alluring when he turned to Igor's aria from Borodin's ''Prince Igor'' and then Yeletsky's aria from Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades,'' each given a commanding and elegant performance. The quality in his voice that had seemed grainy in Verdi sounded beautifully earthy in these Russian works.</p>
        <p>And finally you heard crisp consonants and vibrant renderings of text. Ms. Netrebko sounded lovely in a Czech work, a luminous performance of ''Song to the Moon'' from Dvorak's ''Rusalka.'' Her burnished, poignant and powerful account of Rachmaninoff's song ''Ne poj, krasavica, pri mne,'' was overwhelming.</p>
        <p>The St. Luke's musicians, under the energetic Mr. Fisch, seemed to have fun in music they seldom get to play, though the conductor too often let the orchestra's volume get out of hand. There were encores, of course, including a dangerously seductive account of the duet ''La ci darem la mano'' from Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.''</p>
        <p>Surely these beautiful artists would have wanted what they wore to be reported. Mr. Hvorostovsky looked sexy in black leather pants and an open-collared black shirt. Ms. Netrebko first appeared in a simple, fetching black dress, then switched to a shoulderless cream and sequined gown for the second half. This operatic duo would vanquish the competition on ''America's Top Model.''</p>
