        <p>Opens today nationwide.  Directed by Ash Brannon and Chris Buck  90 minutes</p>
        <p>Ever since Luc Jacquet's endearing documentary ''March of the Penguins'' persuaded Hollywood that penguins are the new Bambis, we have endured singing, wisecracking and even tap-dancing versions. Now, treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's ''Happy Feet,'' comes ''Surf's Up,'' a computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards.</p>
        <p>To deliver its winning-isn't-everything message, this ho-hum addition to the kiddie canon follows Cody Maverick (engagingly voiced by Shia LaBeouf), a young Rockhopper penguin with surfing in his blood and dreams of greatness in his head. Trailed by a documentary film crew, the fatherless Cody (Dad was eaten by a shark) heads for his first professional surfing competition, at which he will learn about love, perseverance and the feet-of-clay principle.</p>
        <p>Assisting in his education is a washed-up champ (Jeff Bridges), a coy lifeguard (Zooey Deschanel) and the reigning titleholder (Diedrich Bader), whose relationship with his trophies borders on the indecent.</p>
        <p>Directed by Ash Brannon and Chris Buck (both contributed to the screenplay), ''Surf's Up'' has a friendly, blue-collar vibe (Cody is an ex-fish-sorter from the Shiverpool, Antarctica) and some sly, low-key humor. Nevertheless, a moratorium on penguins might be called for, despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void. Lord help us if ''Ratatouille'' is a hit.</p>
        <p>JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</p>
        <p>''Surf's Up'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Characters flirt, urinate on one another and behave lewdly with surfing trophies.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2007, Wednesday  A film review in Weekend on Friday about ''Surf's Up'' misidentified the animal that ate Cody's father. It was a killer whale, not a shark.</p>
