        <p>The Taliban released four members of an Afghan medical team kidnapped and held hostage since March after the government handed over the body of the senior Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah, said Qayum Pukhla, the director of the health department in Kandahar. The four, a doctor, two nurses and a driver described as thin and frail, were quickly reunited with their families. Members of the Taliban said that the Afghan government handed over the body of Mullah Dadullah, killed in fighting last month, on Wednesday evening and that was why they released the four hostages. They said they had killed the fifth member of the team, a pharmacist, because the government did not hand over the commander's body within the ultimatum set earlier this week.</p>
