        <p>A federal judge in Miami ruled that the government does not have to provide reporters covering the terrorism trial of Jose Padilla with recordings of wiretapped phone calls until a day after the jury hears them. The judge, Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, did order the government to give reporters transcripts of the recordings the same day they are played in court, but as late as 10 p.m. That could make it difficult or impossible for news outlets to report on the proceedings as they happen. The Associated Press, joined by CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, filed a motion last week requesting the transcripts and tapes on the same day they are presented to the jury.</p>
