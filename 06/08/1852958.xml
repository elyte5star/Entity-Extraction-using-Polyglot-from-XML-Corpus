        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Defeat's Killing Fields'' (Op-Ed, June 7), Peter W. Rodman and William Shawcross condemn those who are ''toying with the idea of American defeat'' in Iraq and list all the horrors that would result. They, like all supporters of this war before and during the conflict, are living in a fantasy world in which one can still be ''for'' or ''against'' defeat.</p>
        <p>The fact is that the United States has already been defeated in this war, that the defeat was predictable, and was in fact predicted even before the invasion. More important than military defeat, the United States has been morally disgraced both for starting the war and for its conduct of the war, unleashing unfathomable levels of death and misery on Iraqis.</p>
        <p>It is the war's initiators and supporters who are responsible for the terrible consequences of the American disgrace in Iraq. It is absurd to be ''against defeat'': what we need now are those who can grapple with its reality.</p>
        <p>Nathaniel Berman  New York, June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of international law at Brooklyn Law School.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Why do supporters of the invasion of Iraq keep repeating the lie that if we leave Iraq now, it would be a defeat? The truth is, we won the war by May 2003, when President Bush correctly declared victory.</p>
        <p>The continued occupation of Iraq since then has been an utter failure, and there is no feasible way to turn that disaster into a victory.</p>
        <p>Peter W. Rodman and William Shawcross assume that our enemies will triumph if we exit Iraq. I disagree. Our enemies in the Middle East are Sunni Al Qaeda and Shiite Iran. The moment we leave Iraq, our enemies will commence fighting each other, and Americans will stop dying in Iraq to ''save face'' for George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Timothy Bal  Belle Mead, N.J., June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter W. Rodham and William Shawcross got it right.</p>
        <p>Vietnam was never an attack on our existence or value system. It was a struggle for independence pure and simple. Al Qaeda in Iraq is a global enemy seeking to destroy everything we stand for, everywhere on earth. It will not and cannot stop in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Our defeat there will again be seen as a victory of Allah over the Great Satan and a prediction of worldwide victory for Islam. The encouragement of our Islamic enemy will be such as to assure that the war will only be strengthened and prolonged.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Riga  Houston, June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter W. Rodman and William Shawcross are following the traditional political script for when an unjust war goes horribly bad: argue that continuing the war is still better than defeat.</p>
        <p>The Johnson and Nixon administrations made all the same arguments that Mr. Rodman and Mr. Shawcross now make once it became obvious that the Vietnam War was a monumental mistake.</p>
        <p>Sadly, these arguments always fall on many sympathetic ears because of people's basic psychological reluctance to accept defeat. The real question now is how to begin restoring the credibility we have lost.</p>
        <p>A continued United States presence in Iraq will be interpreted only as oil theft or, more generally, as obstinate imperialism. Our only just course of action is the long and arduous task of apologizing for our unilateral aggression, offering full reparations for the human disaster we have caused, and, of course, withdrawing our military from Iraq.</p>
        <p>Are we strong enough a nation to behave so maturely? Can we resist the instinctive obstinance Mr. Rodman and Mr. Shawcross try to incite in us?</p>
        <p>Hendrik Van den Berg  Lincoln, Neb., June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter W. Rodman and William Shawcross are correct to say that losing the war in Iraq will further destabilize the Middle East, but the time to avoid this calamity was before the United States invaded Iraq.</p>
        <p>Whatever ''victory'' people envision in Iraq will either commit the United States to being an occupying force indefinitely or require it to further compromise its values by ''destroying the village to save it.'' Either result benefits militant fundamentalists whose paranoid arguments have been strengthened by the invasion.</p>
        <p>If we could get over our fear of appearing  to be the ''weak horse'' and seek to act wisely as well as forcefully, we might begin to reverse the terrible chain reaction that the Bush administration initiated.</p>
        <p>Jamie Baldwin  Redding, Conn., June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter W. Rodman and William Shawcross argue against a United States withdrawal from Iraq, stating that ''American defeat in Iraq would embolden the extremists in the Muslim world, demoralize and perhaps destabilize many moderate friendly governments, and accelerate the radicalization of every conflict in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>What they seem to ignore is that the continued American presence in Iraq is having precisely those effects.</p>
        <p>They say that ''today, in Iraq, there should be no illusion that defeat would come at an acceptable price.'' But they do not ask whether indefinite occupation in the middle of an armed conflict with sectarian, religious extremist, anti-occupation and anti-American elements would have an acceptable price. They provide no strategy for victory or way of quantifying the cost it would take to win.</p>
        <p>Few people doubt that an American withdrawal from Iraq would be bad. The question is whether staying is any better.</p>
        <p>Daniel A. Simon  New York, June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>America's defeat in Iraq occurred the moment we decided on a unilateral invasion based on known false information. It already threw the entire Middle East into greater upheaval. It has also diminished our stature as a nation for many years to come, if not forever.</p>
        <p>As was stated four years ago, there is no right way to do the wrong thing. We're in a hole, and we have to stop digging. Trying to figure out how we can win will produce nothing but blank stares and a deeper hole.</p>
        <p>John Baycich  Rose Valley, Pa., June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have but one serious question for Peter W. Rodman and William Shawcross regarding their ominous warning about accepting defeat in Iraq: What constitutes victory?</p>
        <p>Stephen Stept  Montclair, N.J., June 7, 2007</p>
