        <p>The authorities yesterday interrupted a sophisticated drug organization operating in Crown Heights, said Charles J. Hynes, the district attorney. Raiding several safe houses around the Brooklyn Children's Museum, the police arrested 11 people, ranging in age from 23 to 67, on conspiracy, drug and weapons charges. Investigators secretly videotaped suspects weighing and measuring drugs, then bought or seized 2.8 pounds of cocaine and 8 pounds of marijuana, Mr. Hynes said. They also seized binoculars and radio equipment used for countersurveillance of the police.</p>
