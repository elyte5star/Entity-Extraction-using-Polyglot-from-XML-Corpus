        <p>MARK J. MERSHON, the assistant director in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York City headquarters, is not quite sure he wants it known that he considers the bluish fabric of the office furniture he inherited ''just horrible.'' Slippery. Shiny. Not particularly masculine. Has to be offensive, he notes, for him to even notice it.</p>
        <p>Not that this dissatisfaction rates high on his priority list. And, no, he had no interest in redecorating -- ''God forbid!'' he exclaims, anticipating a gibe from Jim Margolin, the public affairs agent sitting in but not butting in on this chat -- when he volunteered for this critical job in 2005, after pondering retirement toward the end of a three-year stint as head of the San Francisco office.</p>
        <p>''What makes this the biggest challenge in all that we do as an agency is, well, as the late pope said, New York City is the capital of the world,'' he says, leading the way into his spacious sanctum at 26 Federal Plaza. ''Everything you could possibly want is here in abundance, and where you have the big dollars, you have the good and the bad.''</p>
        <p>Since the bad is his purview, he has been busy. Busy enough on some late nights to wish he lived in the city instead of having to commute to New Jersey, his home state, where he lives with his wife and their chocolate Lab, Mocha, an empty-nester acquisition. (They have two grown sons, one of them a police officer in Colorado, where Mr. Mershon was special agent in charge of the Denver office from 1999 to 2002.)</p>
        <p>The New York job is, as he expected when he returned to head the office where his F.B.I. tenure began in 1975, a career-capper. The latest challenge is the yearlong investigation and the arrest this month of four suspects, their supposed ringleader a Guyanese native and naturalized American living in Brooklyn, who the authorities say aspired to blow up Kennedy International Airport.</p>
        <p>The suspects, officials say, aimed to inflict death and destruction reminiscent of the World Trade Center attack; aimed is as far as they got. Mr. Mershon does not take kindly to criticism from some security and terrorism experts that in their pre-emptive zeal, law enforcement officials overstated the potential seriousness of the plot.</p>
        <p>The second-guessers are not, he says, acquainted with the facts. The plot may have been inoperable in its early state, he says, but the plotters themselves were deadly serious.</p>
        <p>''Just imagine the second-guessing if we had walked away from this and later on there was an actual attack; I couldn't live with myself if that happened,'' he says.</p>
        <p>''How capable were they of carrying out the plan?'' he says. ''At this stage, they weren't. But there very definitely was a conspiracy here. The level and intensity of the hatred involved will be quite apparent to everyone when the evidence plays out in court.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mershon, a few weeks shy of 56, is a senior citizen by the F.B.I.'s stringent standards, which mandate retirement at 57. He slides into one of the blue armchairs, which by coincidence match the color of his tie. His wife lays out his workday garb each morning because, he jokes, it leaves him with one fewer decision to make. Gritting his teeth, tightly balling up his fists and gazing out his 28th-floor corner windows at the panoramic uptown view of Manhattan are all involved in his attempts to relax.</p>
        <p>Fifty percent of his caseload is terror-related. Better to prevent a terrorist act than to prosecute in its aftermath, he says, ''especially if the terrorist act is performed by martyrs, because then you have nobody left to prosecute.''</p>
        <p>''You don't have to have a high I.Q.,'' he says of would-be terrorists, ''you just have to be resourceful in a banal way.''</p>
        <p>The airport plot exists, he says. Not so the supposed plot to blow up the city's subway system in October 2005, which caused the F.B.I. and city officials to issue and later retract a terrorism alert.</p>
        <p>''What we thought was a real threat later washed out,'' Mr. Mershon explains. '' Presented with the same circumstances, I'd make the same decision endlessly.''</p>
        <p>Among the cases in his lengthy career, Mr. Mershon supervised the investigation of a dozen ransom kidnappings, all of which ended with the safe return of the victims. But the case that brought him closest into contact with what he calls ''the dark side'' was the kidnapping of 12-year-old Polly Klaas in Petaluma, Calif., in 1993. It took two months to find and arrest the kidnapper, but the victim, Mr. Mershon says, was already dead when he was called into the case.</p>
        <p>THE son of a residential real estate broker, Mr. Mershon grew up in Somerville, N.J., watching ''The Untouchables'' and other law enforcement dramas. By high school he was fixated on a career with the F.B.I.</p>
        <p>He pursued a degree in business administration at the University of Notre Dame after reading, in his freshman year, an article about the F.B.I.'s intention of expanding its investigative capacity in the area of white-collar crime; recruits with accounting skills were sought. He kept the item pinned to his bulletin board and refused to be deterred when, after applying to the agency in his senior year at age 21, he received a discouraging form letter admonishing him to try again at 23, the minimum age for recruits.</p>
        <p>After two years as a senior accountant at Touche Ross and Company, he applied again, this time on his 23rd birthday. They were nicer the second time around.</p>
