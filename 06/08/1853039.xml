        <p>Phil Ford, a Knicks assistant coach the past two seasons, is joining the staff of the Charlotte Bobcats, under their new coach, Sam Vincent. Ford was hired by Larry Brown in 2004 and stayed with the Knicks after Brown was fired a year later.</p>
        <p>Ford's departure leaves the Knicks with a still-sizable staff of five assistant coaches. Head Coach Isiah Thomas has not decided whether to fill the vacancy. Dave Hanners is the only coach hired by Brown to remain on the staff. The move to Charlotte represents a sort of homecoming for Ford, who starred as a point guard at the University of North Carolina.</p>
