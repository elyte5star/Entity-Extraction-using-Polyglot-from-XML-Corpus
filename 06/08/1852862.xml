        <p>Since the first SketchFest in Seattle eight years ago, sketch comedy festivals have been popping up in cities from Los Angeles to Toronto. New York has plenty of cutups too, and it joined the fun two years ago with Sketchfest NYC, an annual event taking place this weekend. ''The goal is to make people realize what sketch comedy is,'' said Alexander Zalben, a producer of Sketchfest NYC. ''It's not just people in their fraternities putting on funny skits about their professors.'' Unlike improvisation or standup comedy, sketch consists of short written scenes rehearsed in advance. (Think of ''Saturday Night Live.'') The content may be funny, but Mr. Zalben and his co-producers, Keith Michel, Becky Poole and Elizabeth Ellis, are serious about this type of humor. ''We weren't going to aim for being the biggest,'' Mr. Zalben said. ''It's more important to aim for a consistent level of quality.'' Instead of opening the festival to all performers, the producers watched more than 100 live-performance tapes, and chose 21 groups for the festival.</p>

Instead of opening the festival to all performers, the producers watched more than 100 live-performance tapes, and chose 21 groups for the festival.</p>
        <p>Tonight's lineup includes groups from Oregon, Boston and even Newfoundland. Also performing are the local groups Fearsome, Trophy Dad and MEAT, a group made up of four women (above, from left: Livia Scott, Ms. Ellis, Reggan Holland and Ms. Poole) who will present ''DEADMEAT V: Camp Blood,'' an all-horror sketch show. Tomorrow's slate includes the Los Angeles groups Summer of Tears and Karla. The festival ends that night with a midnight show featuring the worst, most offensive sketches from many of the weekend's participants. (Tonight and tomorrow, hourly shows from 7 p.m. to midnight, East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, 800-838-3006, BrownPaperTickets.com; $10, $40 for nightly passes and $100 for full festival passes. Nightly lineup is available at sketchfestnyc.com.)</p>
