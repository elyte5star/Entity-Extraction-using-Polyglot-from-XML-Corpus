        <p>Not long ago, Wall Street trembled when it looked as if the slowing American economy might be getting worse. But now, anxiety over the potential for higher inflation, driven by a strong global economy, is preoccupying investors.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, that fear again took its toll on stocks and bonds, giving share prices their steepest three-day decline since markets dropped around the world in February, and the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above 5 percent for the first time since last summer.</p>

        <p>Not long ago, Wall Street trembled when it looked as if the slowing American economy might be getting worse. But now, anxiety over the potential for higher inflation, driven by a strong global economy, is preoccupying investors.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, that fear again took its toll on stocks and bonds, giving share prices their steepest three-day decline since markets dropped around the world in February, and the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above 5 percent for the first time since last summer.</p>
        <p>The market turmoil of recent days was a stark turnaround from the mood on Wall Street at the start of the week, when both the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average hit highs. But as Wall Street all but ruled out the possibility that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates this year, investors swiftly pulled back.</p>
        <p>''You went from one extreme to another,'' said Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. ''People were talking about the Fed having to cut rates; the economy is struggling. And all of a sudden we've swapped to the Fed is going to have to raise rates.''</p>
        <p>This week, cautionary remarks from Fed officials about inflation and signs that labor costs are accelerating reignited concerns that price increases are not yet tame enough to preclude another interest rate increase. As a result, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose yesterday to the highest level since last July. Bonds become a less-attractive investment as uncertainties about inflation increase.</p>
        <p>The unease in the bond market quickly spread to stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down almost 200 points, or 1.5 percent. The S.&amp; P. 500 index, a wider measure of stock performance, fared worse, losing 1.8 percent of its value. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, also fell 1.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Analysts said two factors appeared to be causing the stock sell-off: fears that higher borrowing costs could hurt corporate profits and slow economic growth, and a sense among investors that the recent record climb in share prices had created an opportunity to cash out.</p>
        <p>''We've got some profit taking,'' said Howard Silverblatt, an index analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's. ''And that's good for the market. You just can't keep going up.''</p>
        <p>Despite a dismal last three days, all three major stock indexes are still up more than 5 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>How quickly the stock market stabilizes depends, in part, on how quickly the bond market settles down. And right now, it is not clear whether the sell-off is just a hiccup or something more serious.</p>
        <p>The movement in the bond market has been a reaction to concerns about interest rates both here and overseas. On Wednesday, the European Central Bank raised interest rates a quarter point, to 4 percent -- the eighth increase since December 2005. And yesterday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand also increased rates a quarter-point, to 8 percent.</p>
        <p>If interest rates on United States Treasury notes lag behind foreign rates, American bonds become less attractive to foreign investors. Yields on the 2-year, 10-year and 30-year securities all closed above 5 percent yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sustained higher yields would lift the cost of borrowing for both companies and consumers, squeezing corporate profits and making home loans more expensive.</p>
        <p>''I think the bond market is nervous about the direction of two things: U.S. economic growth, as well as long-term inflation expectations,'' said Anton Pil, global head of fixed income at JPMorgan Private Bank. ''It's a gradual renormalization. I don't think we're finished. I think the sell-off is going to continue well into the summer.''</p>
        <p>Investors had more new economic data to mull over yesterday that suggested the job market remained strong, adding another piece to the multiplying body of evidence that a rate cut by the Fed is unlikely soon.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said that claims for unemployment benefits declined by 1,000, to 309,000, for the week that ended Saturday.</p>
        <p>Still, bond yields have been rising steadily in recent weeks, and some analysts said it was just a matter of time before investors decided to get out.</p>
        <p>''What we've finally been seeing here is just a throwing in of the towel, and no longer fighting the rise in yields,'' said John Canavan, a fixed income analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy, a market research firm in Skillman, N.J.</p>
        <p>Falling bond prices should entice some investors back into the market, he added. ''We've probably flushed out some of the pressure here which will allow Treasuries to stabilize.''</p>
