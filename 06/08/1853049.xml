        <p>The State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the Historic District Commission of Fairfield has the authority to rule on whether an 80-foot-long sculpture may be installed in front of a house in the town's Southport Historic District. The homeowner, Andrew J. Hall, had argued that the artwork, by the German sculptor Anselm Kiefer, was not subject to commission approval because it could not legally be considered a structure. The Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's decision, saying the six-ton concrete and steel work fit within the commission's jurisdiction. Mr. Hall said the decision meant the town ''forfeits a major sculpture by one of the world's greatest artists.''</p>
