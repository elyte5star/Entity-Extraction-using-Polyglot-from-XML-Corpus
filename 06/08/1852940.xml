        <p>The Mexican Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted Thursday to declare parts of a new media law unconstitutional, a blow to the country's two main broadcasters who had hoped to extend their dominance in television to the Internet and telephone service.</p>
        <p>The decision confirmed several preliminary votes by the court's members in the last two weeks as they went through the disputed parts of the law. In an unprecedented move, the hearings were televised and the court members heard experts speak for and against the law.</p>
        <p>Now it goes back to Congress to be rewritten. Although legislators agreed that the existing 47-year-old television law needs to be changed, no one has stepped forward with a proposal. That may force President Felipe Calderón to come up with his own legislation and send it to Congress, which is out of session until September.</p>
        <p>The law was passed in the heat of an election campaign last year, and critics said that it gave new power to the nation's broadcasting duopoly, Televisa and TV Azteca, which control about 90 percent of the industry.</p>
        <p>''The court's determinations invalidate the privileges that the ill-considered reforms of last year granted to the television companies,'' Raúl Trejo Delarbre, a professor at the Autonomous National University of Mexico, wrote on his blog. ''They also establish unshakable parameters to renew the legal framework for broadcast media in Mexico.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said the decision sent a signal that the court favored greater economic competition. Other industries -- including telecommunications, cement and beer -- are also dominated by one or two companies.</p>
        <p>The law was informally known as the Televisa Law because Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language media company, lobbied for it.</p>
        <p>The court struck down a clause in the law that would have allowed the broadcasters to offer Internet or telephone services over parts of the spectrum that would be freed up as they convert to digital programming.</p>
        <p>It also rejected the law's almost automatic renewal of broadcast licenses, and voided a clause that would have awarded new licenses to the highest bidder and opened the way for the government to consider factors like programming when awarding licenses.</p>
        <p>The court gave new authority to the antitrust commission and cleared the way for the president to appoint two commissioners favoring competition to the Federal Telecommunications Commission.</p>
