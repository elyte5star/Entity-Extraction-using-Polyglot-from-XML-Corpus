        <p>Robert Jackson, the chairman of the City Council Education Committee, yesterday proposed a $3.2 million budget outlay to support programs that encourage parent involvement in public schools. ''We want parents to be empowered for themselves and for their children,'' Mr. Jackson, left, said at a news conference on the steps of City Hall, echoing a common complaint by parents that the Department of Education fails to seek their input before making decisions. If approved, the money would help pay for educational outreach, a parents hot line for resolving school issues and other support services.</p>
