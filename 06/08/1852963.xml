        <p>The mother of an unarmed man killed by an undercover police officer seven years ago called on the Bronx district attorney's office yesterday to reopen a criminal investigation after a jury awarded her $10.45 million for the wrongful death of her son.</p>
        <p>The unarmed man, Malcolm Ferguson, 23, was shot on March 1, 2000, during a struggle with Louis Rivera, the plainclothes officer, who was investigating narcotics sales in the Soundview section of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The shooting, which prompted large protests in the neighborhood, occurred two blocks from the apartment building vestibule where Amadou Diallo was shot at 41 times by undercover police officers in 1999.</p>
        <p>After an investigation, the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, declined to file criminal charges against Officer Rivera. Officer Rivera said he had accidentally fired a gunshot that struck Mr. Ferguson in the head as they wrestled in a stairwell. He remains on active duty.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, a Civil Court jury in the Bronx found Officer Rivera responsible for Mr. Ferguson's death and awarded Mr. Ferguson's mother the $10.45 million, including $7 million in punitive damages and $3 million for pain and suffering.</p>
        <p>''I now go back to District Attorney Robert Johnson and ask him to reopen the case,'' Juanita Young, Mr. Ferguson's mother, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I've paid a heavy price the past seven years for trying to get justice for my son.''</p>
        <p>Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's office, said there were no plans to re-examine the shooting.</p>
        <p>''This incident was the subject of a thorough investigation, the details of which were laid out and summarized in a report that was issued for public inspection,'' Mr. Reed said in a statement. ''Civil negligence and criminal liability are different. Each is required to meet a different burden of proof. A determination of civil liability is based upon a 'preponderance of the evidence' whereas criminal liability is determined by 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' ''</p>
        <p>The police found six packets of heroin in Mr. Ferguson's clothes. He was on parole at the time for narcotics sales and had been arrested several times on drug dealing charges.</p>
        <p>Erious Johnson, an assistant corporation counsel, said the city would appeal the civil verdict.</p>
        <p>''As the jury recognized, this was an accidental shooting,'' Mr. Johnson said in a statement. ''We are disappointed with the verdict and do not believe it will withstand an appeal.''</p>
