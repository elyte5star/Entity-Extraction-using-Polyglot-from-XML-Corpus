        <p>Two young men were fatally shot on a street in East Harlem early yesterday, the police said. The victims, Manuel Sabatera, 27, and Joshua Agard, 17, were each shot several times about 4:30 a.m. as they gathered with others who were listening to music and playing dice in front of 404 East 105th Street, an investigator said. A separate group approached Mr. Sabatera and Mr. Agard, with at least one of them firing a .40-caliber handgun, the investigator said. The investigator said Mr. Agard appeared to be the target. Mr. Sabatera was pronounced dead at Metropolitan Hospital Center; Mr. Agard was pronounced dead at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, the police said. There were no arrests yesterday, the police said. Among detectives' leading theories was that drugs played a role, the police said.</p>
