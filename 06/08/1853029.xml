        <p>The Senate Banking Committee and Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York sent joint letters to the nation's 20 largest student lenders, demanding information on how they set rates and fees on student loans, as part of a growing investigation into possible discrimination in student lending. The letter gives lenders until the end of next week to say which criteria they use, including ''college, college location, graduation rate, historic default rate, gender, age, parental income, credit history and any other factors used or considered in underwriting determinations.'' Separately, the House Education Committee made a similar request of the five top student lenders, ''to help determine whether the lenders offer less favorable terms to students at predominately minority colleges, such as historically black colleges and universities, than they offer to students at other four-year public and private colleges.''</p>
