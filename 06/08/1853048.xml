        <p>City officials inspecting a sinkhole yesterday discovered what may be human remains underground, the police said. The sinkhole, near Wilson Avenue and East 214th Street in Williamsbridge, developed several weeks ago and grew to about 3 feet square, neighbors said. Residents had complained to the Department of Environmental Protection, which sent workers yesterday. Department employees found several bones, including what appeared to be a femur and a jaw bone. The remains will be passed to the medical examiner's office, the police said.</p>
