        <p>Prosecutors have disclosed DNA evidence in a triple-murder case against a bar bouncer connected to the Sweet Cherry strip parlor in Sunset Park. Months after the killings, the defendant, Stephen Sakai, was arrested carrying a washcloth with what appeared to be a bloodstain, his lawyer, Kleon C. Andreadis, said yesterday after a pretrial hearing in State Supreme Court. The Brooklyn district attorney's office is expected to try to link the DNA to Mr. Sakai. Mr. Sakai and two of the victims in the case, both of whom were killed in 2005, worked or spent time at the Sweet Cherry, which the authorities finally shut down last year after nearly a decade of trying. In a separate case in Manhattan, Mr. Sakai is charged with shooting four patrons outside a dance club in Chelsea in May 2006, killing one.</p>
