        <p>Sculpture Sale Is a Record</p>
        <p>An ancient Roman bronze sculpture of the goddess Artemis with a stag, left, was sold yesterday at Sotheby's in New York for $28.6 million, the highest price ever paid for a sculpture or an antiquity at auction. The London dealer Giuseppe Eskenazi said he bought the work, dating from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D., on behalf of a private European collector whom he declined to identify. Sotheby's had estimated that the sculpture would go for $5 million to $7 million. The sculpture had been in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, which is in the midst of a controversial sale of older works so that it can raise money to finance purchases of contemporary art. Richard M. Keresey, an antiquities specialist at Sotheby's, had called the 36-inch-tall bronze ''the best single piece I've seen here in 37 years.'' The previous auction record for a sculpture was set in May 2005 when Brancusi's ''Bird in Space'' went for $27.5 million at Christie's in New York; the previous auction record for an antiquity was the $11.6 million paid for the so-called Jenkins Venus, a marble statue, at Christie's in London in June 2002. Reached on his cellphone Mr. Eskenazi said that he jumped into the bidding after the price reached $14 million and then squared off against one remaining bidder. ''He was very determined -- I thought he'd never give up,'' he said. ''I feel exhaustion, to be honest.'' Mr. Eskenazi triumphed with a hammer price of $25.5 million. (Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>Akon in Trouble</p>
        <p>The platinum-selling singer Akon, above, is under investigation after a clash that ended with him tossing a teenage concertgoer off the stage and onto an audience member who said she suffered a concussion, The Associated Press reported. Witnesses said the trouble erupted Sunday at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, N.Y., where a spectator threw something at the singer, and Akon, 34, asked the crowd to point out the culprit. A guard singled out a 15-year-old boy, whose name was not released, and sent him to the stage, where Akon hurled him into the audience, The Poughkeepsie Journal reported. The boy landed on Abby Rosa, who said she soon experienced a headache and blurry vision. Detective Lt. John Berlingieri of the Fishkill Police said no criminal charges had yet been filed. Earlier this year Akon caused a furor with a sexually explicit onstage dance with a girl later revealed to be 14. He apologized, saying he did not know she was under-age.</p>
        <p>Sean Connery Resigns His Professorship</p>
        <p>Sean Connery said yesterday that he won't be playing dad to Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones anymore, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Connery, 76, played Prof. Henry Jones, father of the intrepid archeologist, in the 1989 adventure ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' below. With a fourth Indian Jones film, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas, scheduled to go before the cameras this month, speculation had mounted that Mr. Connery would return, although he had announced his retirement from acting in 2005. ''I thought long and hard about it, and if anything could have pulled me out of retirement, it would have been an Indiana Jones film,'' he said in a statement posted on the Lucasfilm Indiana Jones Web site (www.indianajones.com). ''But in the end, retirement is just too damned much fun.'' The film is scheduled for release in May 2008.</p>
        <p>Patricia Cornwell Wins Injunction</p>
        <p>A federal judge in Richmond, Va., has ordered Leslie R. Sachs, a self-published author, to end an Internet vendetta that leveled accusations of plagiarism, bribery and anti-Semitism against Patricia Cornwell, below, the best-selling author of novels featuring the medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sachs even contended that Ms. Cornwell was plotting to have him murdered. Ms. Cornwell, 50, said Mr. Sachs, 52, had made no direct threats but said his allegations had caused her fear, anxiety and sleeplessness. After long ignoring him she sued Mr. Sachs for libel when the Internet attacks increased. Judge Norman K. Moon granted Ms. Cornwell's motion for a permanent injunction, saying that the statements were false and ''calculated to expose plaintiff to public contempt or ridicule'' and were published with actual malice. Mr. Sachs did not immediately respond to an e-mail message from The Associated Press seeking comment.</p>
        <p>British 'Big Brother' Contestant Expelled</p>
        <p>An allegation of racism has led to the ouster of a contestant from the British reality television show ''Big Brother,'' The Associated Press reported. Emily Parr, 19, a student, was removed after using a derogatory term about a black contestant on Wednesday night, Channel 4 in Britain said yesterday. The remark was not broadcast live. Channel 4 was forced to apologize two weeks ago after regulators ruled that the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' program violated broadcasting rules by showing footage of racist insults directed at the Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Channel 4 said that in light of reaction to the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' incident it had not choice but to expel Ms. Parr.</p>
