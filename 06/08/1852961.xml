        <p>Many things draw visitors to New York: Broadway musicals, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, games at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>For Jim Cavanaugh, it has always been cows.</p>
        <p>It was cows that first brought him from Kansas to New York for the 1939 New York World's Fair. And it was cows that brought Mr. Cavanaugh, now 90, back to New York yesterday.</p>
        <p>''It just looks busier than ever,'' Mr. Cavanaugh said yesterday as he stood watching cars go by on the West Side of Manhattan. He figured he had been to the city four times in his life. ''I am amazed they don't have more fender benders, the way they drive around,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanaugh was on hand to show off Elsie, a horned Jersey dairy cow who, for about an hour, stood in the hot sun behind a custom picket fence on the sidewalk outside the New-York Historical Society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanaugh was there as part of a ceremony in which the museum was given a photographic plate and a scrapbook that had belonged to Gail Borden, who in the mid-1800s invented condensed milk and helped start a dairy company.</p>
        <p>The first time Mr. Cavanaugh came to New York, he was in college, studying animal husbandry at Kansas State Agricultural College. He boarded a bus in Manhattan, Kan., and got off in the other Manhattan. He was chosen to be one of the Gotham Herdsmen who would help handle the cows in a pavilion for the 1939 World's Fair called Borden's Dairy World of Tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the pavilion would see a barn of the future made of glass walls with cows revolving on a mechanism called the Rotolactor as they were being milked. The Rotolactor was a hit.</p>
        <p>For about six months, Mr. Cavanaugh showed off the cattle. Many visitors had never seen a live cow. Mr. Cavanaugh told the gullible visitors that the cud the cows were chewing was bubblegum and the pink salt the cows were licking was lipstick.</p>
        <p>Elsie had already become such a well-known mascot for the dairy company that visitors would ask for her by name. It was Mr. Cavanaugh's job to help choose the cow that would become Elsie for the fair.</p>
        <p>He had picked a cow from Massachusetts with perky ears, bright eyes and long lashes that had been named You'll Do Lobelia. Mr. Cavanaugh recalled escorting her to a dancehall pavilion at the fair, where a bandleader introduced Elsie as ''the biggest stripper in town.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanaugh and his fellow cow handlers lived on the Upper West Side, where they became friendly with young women studying teaching at Barnard College. He spoke fondly of dancing to Tommy Dorsey's band at downtown nightclubs.</p>
        <p>On nights he was feeling generous, Mr. Cavanaugh said, he spent 25 cents to take his date to her parents' home aboard the Long Island Rail Road. On other nights, he rode the subway to Flushing, Queens, for a mere nickel.</p>
        <p>After the fair, Mr. Cavanaugh went on the road. Even though it was November, he said he was thrilled to ride a boxcar across the country and into British Columbia, returning cows that had been picked to be in the fair to their owners. ''Some guys took a cow to Pittsburgh, and that was it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He favored hitchhiking and taking buses back home to Kansas over a first-class train ticket the company had provided. On the way, he stayed with cattle breeders.</p>
        <p>After World War II, he worked for the Jersey Cattle Club, an association based in Ohio that registered and advocated for Jersey cows over the better-known black and white Holstein breed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanaugh's cow travel took him to Japan, India, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. ''This didn't happen to very many people,'' he said of his experiences, which all began with that trip to the city nearly 70 years ago.</p>
        <p>As a Roman Catholic who goes to Mass every day, Mr. Cavanaugh has hung a picture of the pope in his home. Next to that photo is a framed picture of another love -- Elsie.</p>
