        <p>As if acknowledging the challenges it faces in finding an American audience, ''La Vie en Rose,'' Olivier Dahan's long, feverish film biography of Édith Piaf, notes that its heroine, an incomparably bright star in the French cultural firmament, never quite caught on over here. After a less than rapturous stateside reception, the film's Piaf (played by Marion Cotillard) observes that Americans just don't get her, and though she seems to have a good time in New York and California, the incomprehension appears to have been mutual. She won't even try a corned beef sandwich at a Manhattan delicatessen.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dahan's film goes some way toward bridging the gap. This is not because it explains Piaf's appeal -- though it does offer viewers a chance to sample the glories of her voice -- but rather because it assimilates her life neatly into the conventions of the musical biopic. It turns out that we Americans don't have a monopoly on singers and composers who emerge from traumatic childhoods, battle drug addiction, pursue difficult love affairs and win the hearts of millions. It also turns out that, while musical idioms sometimes have a hard time crossing the barriers of language and culture, certain narrative clichés are universal.</p>

        <p>As if acknowledging the challenges it faces in finding an American audience, ''La Vie en Rose,'' Olivier Dahan's long, feverish film biography of Édith Piaf, notes that its heroine, an incomparably bright star in the French cultural firmament, never quite caught on over here. After a less than rapturous stateside reception, the film's Piaf (played by Marion Cotillard) observes that Americans just don't get her, and though she seems to have a good time in New York and California, the incomprehension appears to have been mutual. She won't even try a corned beef sandwich at a Manhattan delicatessen.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dahan's film goes some way toward bridging the gap. This is not because it explains Piaf's appeal -- though it does offer viewers a chance to sample the glories of her voice -- but rather because it assimilates her life neatly into the conventions of the musical biopic. It turns out that we Americans don't have a monopoly on singers and composers who emerge from traumatic childhoods, battle drug addiction, pursue difficult love affairs and win the hearts of millions. It also turns out that, while musical idioms sometimes have a hard time crossing the barriers of language and culture, certain narrative clichés are universal.</p>
        <p>So if you have seen ''Ray'' or ''Walk the Line,'' you will hardly require a summary of ''La Vie en Rose,'' which flings its subject back and forth in time, simultaneously charting her rise from the tough streets of Paris and her decline into drug abuse and ill health. There are tearful confrontations, moments of bliss and betrayal, tantrums and onstage collapses, love affairs and business deals, all of it punctuated by the big, expressive, unmistakable singing of Piaf herself, as Ms. Cotillard, wide-eyed and fine-boned, lip-syncs along.</p>
        <p>The celebrity biopic is decidedly an actor's genre. The number of great movies made out of great artists' lives is tiny, especially in proportion to the number of supposedly great performances these movies have occasioned. In this kind of picture the story, the production design and the mise-en-scène need only provide adequate scaffolding for a heroically superfluous act of impersonation.</p>
        <p>No one else could possibly be Édith Piaf, or Johnny Cash or Ray Charles (or Truman Capote or Muhammad Ali or anyone else on the ever-growing list). Their larger-than-life self-sufficiency adds a thrilling element of risk to the task of portraying any of them on film. Or so it would seem. Really, though, the audacity involved in taking up such a challenge predisposes audiences (and critics) to applause, as does the durable popularity of the originals. So it is hard not to admire Ms. Cotillard for the discipline and ferocity she brings to the role. But it is equally hard to be completely swept up in Mr. Dahan's dutiful, functional and ultimately superficial film.</p>
        <p>''La Vie en Rose,'' which Mr. Dahan wrote as well as directed, has an intricate structure, which is a polite way of saying that it's a complete mess. Resisting the habit of starting at the end and flashing back to the beginning, it begins at the late middle, goes back to the beginning, comes back to the near-end, jumps around in the early and middle middle and then noodles around between a bunch of almost-ends and the really absolutely final end, with a quick, baffling detour into an earlier part of the early middle. Clear enough?</p>
        <p>The main casualty of this willy-nilly narration is any coherent sense of Piaf's personality. It may be that Mr. Dahan and his collaborators did not want to subject their heroine to the indignity of psychological explanation, preferring to let her charisma rule the screen without qualification or compromise. And it is true that Ms. Cotillard is a dynamic, quick-witted performer, one whose sheer force of will goes some way toward showing how a funny-looking, abrasive street urchin could become the idol of postwar France.</p>
        <p>But not quite far enough. Who was Piaf? The miserable childhood, with its saving moments of tenderness, is duly noted. Papa was a circus contortionist, Mama was a hopeless drunk, and little Édith lived for a while in Grandma's brothel, where she was befriended by a soulful prostitute named Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner) and where she was briefly blinded by keratitis. Later Édith and her best pal, Momone (Sylvie Testud), sing on the streets of Paris -- actually Momone makes faces and swigs wine while Édith belts out the songs -- where Édith is discovered by a nightclub impresario (Gérard Depardieu).</p>
        <p>He gives her a stage name. (Piaf means ''sparrow.'') She is a hit. He is murdered. She is a suspect. What really happened? We don't know, but in any case she soon moves on to a new mentor, and then to a love affair with the boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins). Also at least one marriage, several car accidents and one brilliantly shot sequence, by far the best in the movie, in which she learns of a lover's death.</p>
        <p>To help us sort though it all, dates appear at the bottom of the screen. Oddly, the years of the Second World War are left out, an omission that seems puzzling given that Piaf is known to have aided the Resistance during the Nazi occupation (even as she continued to perform). But many of Mr. Dahan's dramatic choices are puzzling, and his breathless camera movements seem driven more by desperation than by enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>In the end, as often happens in movies of this kind, ''La Vie en Rose'' is saved by Piaf herself. Most of the songs in the film are accompanied by subtitles. (An exception is ''Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien,'' the signature of her last years.) They are hardly necessary, given the undiminished power of that voice. Unfortunately the movie isn't either.</p>
        <p>''La Vie en Rose'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has subtitled swearing, drug use and some sexual references.</p>
        <p>La Vie en Rose  Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Written (in French, with English subtitles) and directed by Olivier Dahan; director of photography, Tetsuo Nagata; edited by Richard Marizy; music by Christopher Gunning; production designer, Olivier Raoux; produced by Alain Goldman; released by Picturehouse. Running time: 140 minutes.</p>
        <p>WITH: Marion Cotillard (Édith Piaf), Sylvie Testud (Momone), Pascal Greggory (Louis Barrier), Emmanuelle Seigner (Titine), Jean-Paul Rouve (Louis Gassion), Clotilde Courau (Anetta), Jean-Pierre Martins (Marcel Cerdan), Catherine Allegret (Louise), Marc Barbe (Raymond Asso) and Gérard Depardieu (Louis Leplée).</p>
