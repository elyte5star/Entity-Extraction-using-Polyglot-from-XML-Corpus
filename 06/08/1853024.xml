        <p>Hundreds of angry students rioted on Wednesday night in the central city of Zhengzhou after a city inspector beat a female student, according to a Hong Kong-based rights group, the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. It reported that students from three universities poured into the streets, overturning cars and destroying property for more than four hours. The rampage apparently erupted after an inspector knocked out the front teeth of the female student, who was running an illegal street vending stall. The police later detained a handful of students. A local newspaper also reported that several inspectors were later fired or reprimanded.</p>
