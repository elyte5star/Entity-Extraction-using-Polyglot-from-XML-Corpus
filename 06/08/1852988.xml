        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Keven McAlester  Not rated; 94 minutes</p>
        <p>Early in the documentary ''You're Gonna Miss Me,'' the film's subject, the psychedelic rocker and drug-damaged schizophrenic Roky Erickson, ambles through his Austin, Tex., home, clutching a Mr. Potato Head doll. It's a potent image that's all the more effective for being tossed off: Mr. Erickson, the lead singer of the 13th Floor Elevators and maybe the most influential 1960s pop star that most folks haven't heard of, has had so little control over his life and image for so many years that he's become a goofy blank slate.</p>

        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Keven McAlester  Not rated; 94 minutes</p>
        <p>Early in the documentary ''You're Gonna Miss Me,'' the film's subject, the psychedelic rocker and drug-damaged schizophrenic Roky Erickson, ambles through his Austin, Tex., home, clutching a Mr. Potato Head doll. It's a potent image that's all the more effective for being tossed off: Mr. Erickson, the lead singer of the 13th Floor Elevators and maybe the most influential 1960s pop star that most folks haven't heard of, has had so little control over his life and image for so many years that he's become a goofy blank slate.</p>
        <p>Luckily, the director Keven McAlester keeps Mr. Erickson's humanity front and center. He lets music critics and musicians praise Mr. Erickson's smiling banshee voice (which influenced Janis Joplin) and pioneering use of feedback, but he doesn't insist on his subject's genius or oversell his importance.</p>
        <p>He's more interested in Mr. Erickson's spiral into despair, through drugs and mental illness, and his slow climb to something like normalcy. The film credits much of his recovery to his youngest brother, Sumner Erickson, who took custody of him in 2001 and helped him resolve long-festering royalty issues.</p>
        <p>Also noteworthy is the film's superb cinematography, by Lee Daniel, a frequent Richard Linklater collaborator. His striking compositions and purposeful camera moves mirror Sumner Erickson's quest to create order from chaos.</p>
