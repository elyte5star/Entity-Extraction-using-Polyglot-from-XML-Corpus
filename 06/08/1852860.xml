        <p>With good reason, the city of Vienna holds a distinguished place in the history of classical music. Its jazz legacy is much more difficult to pin down, but there have been significant advances in recent years. The city now has a handful of noteworthy clubs, including Joe Zawinul's Birdland, owned by Austria's best-known jazz musician. (He recorded his latest release, ''Brown Street,'' at the club in 2005.) Naturally, there's also a Vienna Jazz Festival, which began in 1991; this year's edition kicks off on June 25. And there have been an increasing number of collaborations between Vienna-based musicians and their American counterparts; one of the newest and best is ''Friendly Travelers'' (Material), by the guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel and the drummer Brian Blade. The Mostly Jazz Festival, presented by the Austrian Cultural Forum in Midtown Manhattan, celebrates this spirit of transnational exchange even as it makes the case for an independent Austrian jazz aesthetic. '' 'No boundaries' seems to be the unspoken motto of musicians in Vienna,'' writes Helge Hinteregger, the festival's curator, in a program essay. (He doesn't say whether the titular echo of Mostly Mozart, Lincoln Center's venerable festival, is fully intentional, though it probably is.) The series begins tonight with Big Four, consisting of the veteran Austrian saxophonist Max Nagl, the Paris-born guitarist Noël Akchoté and two Americans, the trumpeter Steven Bernstein and the bassist Brad Jones. They perform at 7, followed by an inventive young trio called Kelomat, above, led by the saxophonist Wolfgang Schiftner. Tomorrow there's another group featuring Mr. Schiftner, aptly named Vienna-New York Connection and including the saxophonist Tony Malaby. As for Mr. Nagl, he resurfaces on Tuesday with a project he calls Wumm Zack. The early slot tomorrow goes to Bassinstinct, an assembly of six double bassists. And on Monday, the pianist Hannes Löschel will entrust his own compositions to several well-qualified American improvisers -- the multireedist Ned Rothenberg, the guitarist David Tronzo and the bassist Lindsay Horner -- before a set of free improvisation by the saxophonist Clemens Salesny and the pianist Clemens Wenger. (Tonight through Tuesday night at 7 and 8, Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, 212-319-5300, acfny.org; free.)</p>
