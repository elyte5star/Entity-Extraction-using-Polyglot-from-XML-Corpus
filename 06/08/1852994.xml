        <p>To the Editor: Re ''In Cajun Country, a Fight to the Finish'' (June 1): The struggle in Louisiana's legislature over exactly how and when to outlaw the barbaric practice of cockfighting is certainly a topic worthy of reporting and analysis in your news pages. But it is hardly an appropriate subject for the Escapes section, complete with advice about which restaurants to eat at on one's way to witness this disgusting sport before a new ban goes into effect. Would you run a travel story telling people which hotels to stay in while on their way to gawk at homeless people in Calcutta or soccer hooligans in Leeds? Notwithstanding our hurricanes, there are still lots of worthwhile sites to visit in Louisiana. Surely The Times could do better than to endorse this sort of slumming.</p>
        <p>Stuart P. Green  Baton Rouge, La.</p>
        <p>To the Editor: It is very disturbing that The Times saw fit to publish an article about the cruel practice of cockfighting in the Escapes section. That this barbaric ''sport'' is illegal in 49 states is a recognition that it inflicts agony on living, breathing beings. The story itself is troubling, but your placement of it among travel and vacation articles suggests that cockfighting is a worthy leisure-time activity and that one should hurry to see a match before an American tradition is gone forever. There is nothing romantic about an activity where roosters are honed as killing machines and viewers scream for blood.</p>
        <p>Carolyn Silvers  New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>To the Editor: I find it remarkably sad and extremely ironic that we continue to debate and pass laws that prohibit cockfighting in the United States under the auspices of animal cruelty, when other more hideous acts of cruelty exhibited toward animals occur daily. The final product of these endeavors quite literally appears right under our very noses at the dinner table. The acts of cruelty that surely occur within the cockfighting subculture hardly warrant any comparison to the horrors exhibited in the United States factory farming industry. Both industries are motivated by profit and greed; factory farming, however, is supported by federal and local governments and you, the taxpayer and consumer. This industry continues to unnecessarily systematically torture and senselessly abuse animals while we consume its meat, dairy and apparel byproducts while sadly we remain callous to this repugnant and absolutely unnecessary suffering.</p>
