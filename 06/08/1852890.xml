        <p>Last fall the theater company Peculiar Works Project took audiences back in time by way of a tour that meandered through Greenwich Village, stopping at Off Off Broadway's earliest locales. Along the way actors performed excerpts from seminal works of downtown theater. But the company was only telling half the story.</p>
        <p>Now ''OFF Stage: The East Village Fragments,'' which begins previews on Thursday, will tell the rest of the tale. Eighty actors will enact scenes from plays that originated at La MaMa, Theater Genesis, the Tempo Theater and other performance spaces. The group hopes also to bring more permanent attention to the downtown theatrical legacy and is working to persuade the city to install plaques at the sites, said Catherine Porter, one of its three co-artistic directors.</p>
