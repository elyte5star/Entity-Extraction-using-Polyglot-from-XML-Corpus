        <p>Alex Salmond, the newly elected first minister of Scotland, expressed concern Thursday that the British government had struck a deal that might permit the only person convicted in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing to return to Libya to complete his sentence.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ''totally wrong'' to suggest that a so-called memorandum of understanding on legal matters signed with Libya last week covered the case of the Libyan, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, who is serving a 27-year jail term in Scotland.</p>
        <p>He was sentenced in 2001 for his part in the bombing of PanAm Flight 103 from London to New York, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, 189 of them Americans.</p>
        <p>Despite the British denial, word of the convicted bomber's possible move to Libya stirred outrage and dismay among some of the relatives of those who died in the bombing, Britain's bloodiest terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., lost her only child, Theodora, when the Boeing 747 exploded on Dec. 21, 1988, and said she was getting calls from Scottish newspapers about the reported agreement. ''I really feel quite wretched,'' she said. ''We have no justice at all here.''</p>
        <p>''This is absolutely appalling if this happens,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salmond made the announcement at a special session of the Scottish parliament. He became first minister after regional elections in May that permitted his Scottish National Party to form a minority government in Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Blair signed the agreement on May 29 during a visit to Libya as part of a farewell tour of Africa before his planned resignation on June 27. Mr. Salmond noted that Mr. Megrahi had appealed the length of his sentence, while the Scottish authorities are appealing to extend it.</p>
        <p>''One obvious concern would be that this memorandum could be interpreted as having implications for that due process of law,'' Mr. Salmond said. The Scottish authorities, he said, had long received assurances that ''any sentence imposed would be served in Scotland.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Blair's office said: ''There is a legal process currently under way in Scotland reviewing this case, which is not expected to conclude until late this summer.</p>
        <p>''Given that, it is totally wrong to suggest that we have reached any agreement with the Libyan government in this case. The memorandum of understanding agreed with the Libyan government does not cover this case.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair's office confirmed that the memorandum related to legal issues, including extradition, but said the details and reach of the agreement still had to be negotiated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence official, was convicted 13 years after the bombing and 10 years after he was first indicted. Under a complicated international agreement, his trial, along with that of his co-defendant, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was held under Scottish law at a court in the Netherlands. Mr. Fhimah was found not guilty.</p>
