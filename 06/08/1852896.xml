        <p>8 P.M. (Disney) JOHNNY KAPAHALA: BACK ON BOARD (2007) In this sequel to ''Johnny Tsunami,'' the 1999 Disney movie, Johnny Kapahala (Brandon Baker, left), now a 17-year-old Vermont snowboarder, returns to his hometown in Hawaii for the wedding of his surfer grandfather (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) -- and meets 12-year-old Chris, who is soon to be his uncle. Turns out that Uncle Chris (Jake T. Austin) is a budding rebel with a passion for mountain boarding and a surly attitude. When Chris joins the Dirt Devils, a tough boarding crew, Johnny tries his hand at the sport in an attempt at family bonding. Beware: rocky patches ahead!</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Nickelodeon) NED'S DECLASSIFIED SCHOOL SURVIVAL GUIDE TO FIELD TRIPS, PERMISSION SLIPS, SIGNS AND WEASELS -- The know-it-all Ned Bigby (Devon Werkheiser) breaks free from the constraints of the classroom in this television movie, based on the series, and chases his dream girl in the process. But who -- his best friend, Moze (Lindsey Shaw), or his biggest crush, Suzie (Christian Serratos) -- will seal the deal with a kiss? A marathon of the cast's favorite ''Declassified'' episodes, and a behind-the-scenes special, starts at 5 p.m. as part of a ''Ned Shred Weekend.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Mr. Werkheiser summons his cyberhero alter-ego, Nolan Byrd, in ''Shredderman Rules!''</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (BBC America) THE GIL MAYO MYSTERIES -- Alistair McGowan, right, stars in this new series based on the novels by Marjorie Eccles about a wisecracking detective who charms his way through murder cases alongside his former flame Alex Jones (Jessica Oyelowo). The work continues at home, where he struggles to rear his teenage daughter, Julie (Lucy Evans), after the disappearance of his wife. But never mind the bills: he just stuffs them in a cupboard.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Sci Fi) STARGATE SG-1 -- Jacek (Fred Willard), Vala's father, contacts Stargate Command in an attempt to trade information about a series of planned attacks on Earth in exchange for sanctuary on the planet. Hmm.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) STANDOFF -- Matt Flannery (Ron Livingston) and Emily Lehman (Rosemarie DeWitt), those F.B.I. negotiators whose biggest crisis may be their own romantic involvement, return after a hiatus.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR: WEDDING SPECTACULAR -- Stacy and Clinton give three brides-to-be advice on how best to wear white.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Animal Planet) MY DADDY THE CROCODILE HUNTER -- Eight-year-old Bindi Irwin follows in the footsteps of her father, Steve, in her first special, a prelude to her new series, ''Bindi: The Jungle Girl,'' which begins tomorrow at 5 p.m. on the Discovery Kids. Tonight she speaks about growing up alongside the Crocodile Hunter, who was killed by a stingray in September, and how he taught her to love all creatures. Her mother, Terri Irwin, helps out.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (IFC) THE HENRY ROLLINS SHOW -- Don Cheadle talks about his new book, ''Not on Our Watch: The Mission to End Genocide in Darfur and Beyond.'' Rufus Wainwright performs.</p>
