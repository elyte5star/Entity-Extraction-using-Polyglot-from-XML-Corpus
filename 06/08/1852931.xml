        <p>In protests around the country, thousands of lawyers and members of opposition parties demonstrated Thursday against new government curbs on the news media, as senior military and intelligence officials presented affidavits to the Supreme Court in the case against the suspended chief justice.</p>
        <p>The political crisis over the suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in March has shown no sign of abating. Indeed, the uproar and protests over Mr. Chaudhry's refusal to submit to the suspension has created the greatest challenge to the rule of Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, since he seized power in a coup in 1999.</p>
        <p>Apparently in an effort to curb news coverage of the crisis, General Musharraf issued a decree on Monday giving the government broader power to shut down independent television channels. The decree spurred the protests on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Two intelligence chiefs and the president's chief of staff, Hamid Javed -- who is a retired lieutenant general -- submitted affidavits to the Supreme Court on Thursday countering some of the chief justice's claims about his meeting with General Musharraf and other government officials on March 9, when he was suspended from his post and placed under house arrest for several days.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Javed's affidavit, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz presented General Musharraf with a memorandum the day before advising him to suspend Mr. Chaudhry.</p>
        <p>The director general of military intelligence, Maj. Gen. Nadeem Ijaz, suggested in his own affidavit that Mr. Chaudhry had political ambitions. General Ijaz said the chief justice had at one point suggested that the president dissolve Parliament and appoint him as head of an interim government to oversee new elections.</p>
        <p>''He wanted me to assure all concerned that he (C.J.P.) will make things very smooth,'' the affidavit said. The initials stand for chief justice of Pakistan. Under the Pakistani system, when Parliament is dissolved for an election campaign, an interim government is formed, usually headed by the retiring speaker of the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chaudhry's lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, rejected the accusation, and others, as absurd and fictitious.</p>
        <p>General Ijaz, Mr. Javed and the director general of the Intelligence Bureau, Ijaz Shah, a retired brigadier, all indicated that the chief justice, contrary to his account, had requested the meeting with the president because he was concerned about accusations being brought against him.</p>
        <p>They denied that General Musharraf had summoned Mr. Chaudhry to force him to resign or that they had prevented from leaving the room and had put pressure on him to quit. General Ijaz said he had been present at the meeting at the chief justice's request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chaudhry, who continues to contest his removal from office, said in his own affidavit last week that he had been held against his will for several hours by the heads of Pakistan's three main intelligence bureaus and pressed to resign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Javed on Thursday also provided details of some of the charges of misconduct that General Musharraf raised with the chief justice, which apparently form the basis of the government's case against him.</p>
        <p>Among the accusations were that Mr. Chaudhry had charged gasoline for his family car to the Supreme Court and had demanded a later-model Mercedes as his official automobile and a large motorcade when visiting the provinces. There were also allegations that he had intimidated the police and bureaucrats and that he had shown bias in appointing judges.</p>
        <p>''The statements are absurd,'' said Mr. Ahsan, the chief justice's lawyer. ''They are fictitious. They are fabricated and figments of imagination of the persons who are subordinates to the referring authority.'' He added that he had hoped to receive an account of the meeting from the president himself.</p>
        <p>General Musharraf showed exasperation at a meeting on Wednesday with senior members of the governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League, which gives him his base of support in Parliament, according to The News, a Pakistani daily.</p>
        <p>The paper said General Musharraf had berated members of Parliament and government ministers for failing to support him sufficiently in public.</p>
        <p>''I feel disturbed for the first time,'' the paper quoted the president as saying. ''I see the party nowhere. You are not mobilized. You are not delivering. You have lost the war of nerves. You are all silent upon what the media is doing. If I myself have to do everything, then you are for what purpose?''</p>
