        <p>Dancing in the Streets' free summer events are not to be missed, especially when they take place in Red Hook, a Brooklyn neighborhood with an appealing mix of industrial grit and big stretches of sky. Tomorrow the organization presents ''Hip Hop Generation Next,'' a joint effort by five Brooklyn youth groups that is led by the veteran dancer Brandon Albright (or Peace), the artistic director of Illstyle &amp; Peace Productions in Philadelphia. This five-hour block party focuses on four areas of hip-hop culture: D.J.-ing, M.C.-ing, breaking and creating graffiti. After an opening performance by Adia Whitaker's neo-folkloric Ase Dance Theater Collective, Mr. Albright, accompanied by D.J. Swift and D.J. Forrest (a k a Getemgump) will lead a cipher, or dance circle, and an open-mike session. All are welcome to join. Then, for the next two hours, various performances will trace the links between African and Caribbean dance forms and American hip-hop. Mr. Albright's Illstyle &amp; Peace Productions company will cover everything from West Coast styles of the 1970s, like locking and popping, to Philadelphia's current Wu-tang style. And it all ends with a jam session, of course. (Tomorrow, rain or shine, from 2 to 7 p.m., Coffey Park, Dwight Street between Verona Street and Visitation Place, Red Hook, 212-625-3505, dancinginthestreets.org.)</p>
