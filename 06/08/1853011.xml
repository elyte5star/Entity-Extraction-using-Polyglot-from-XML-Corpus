        <p>A sports headline and an article in some copies yesterday about the Anaheim Ducks' defeat of the Ottawa Senators to capture the Stanley Cup referred incorrectly to the accomplishment. Anaheim is the first West Coast team to win the Cup since the National Hockey League took control starting with the 1927 playoffs; it is not the first West Coast team ever to win the championship. That distinction is held by the Vancouver Millionaires, who took the Cup in 1915. (The Seattle Metropolitans won in 1917, and the Victoria Cougars in 1925.)</p>
