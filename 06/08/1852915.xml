        <p>Senate Democrats praised the three-star Army general picked by President Bush as the new Iraq coordinator but sought to bury elements of that Iraq policy, saying the need to appoint an Iraq ''czar'' four years after the invasion proved the White House had lost control of the war effort.</p>
        <p>In a hearing that alternated between back-slapping and back-stabbing, Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, nominated as assistant to the president for Iraq and Afghanistan, was assured by Democrats that he exemplified the military's highest standards of professionalism and would be confirmed easily.</p>
        <p>But General Lute was also told that his new duties should have been carried out by others.</p>
        <p>''Afghanistan, Iraq, and related to that, Iran, are the most critical foreign policy problems we face, and the national security adviser of the United States has taken his hands off that and given it to you?'' Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, asked General Lute. ''Is that your understanding? Well, then he should be fired.''</p>
        <p>Senator Reed said the mission facing General Lute should have been the responsibility over the past four years of Condoleezza Rice, the president's first national security adviser, and now her successor, Stephen J. Hadley.</p>
        <p>''All you're being asked to do was what Mr. Hadley and Dr. Rice were supposed to be doing for the last several years: identify problems, coordinate resources, bring it to the attention of the president, get presidential direction -- and that has been abysmal,'' Senator Reed said.</p>
        <p>Two senior Republicans, Senators John W. Warner of Virginia and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, rushed to defend Mr. Hadley's record of service.</p>
        <p>''I believe Mr. Hadley has a tremendous challenge -- he has a worldwide challenge,'' Senator Sessions said. ''He's with the G-8, I think, with the president today. He's got China, he's got South America, he's got Africa, he's got Russia -- all of those things on his plate that the National Security Council does, and I'm not sure they are configured or ever were considered to be an entity to really get into the details of managing the difficulties we're facing in Iraq today.''</p>
        <p>General Lute, who has extensive experience as the director of operations with the American military command for the Middle East, as well as with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained that he viewed his role as ''Steve Hadley's teammate on Iraq and Afghanistan.''</p>
        <p>A statement from Mr. Hadley's spokesman, Gordon D. Johndroe, said that General Lute's new job within the White House was ''created to ensure that all resources of the federal government are engaged promptly and effectively in pursuing our strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan.''</p>
        <p>As to the chain of responsibility, the general ''will report directly to the president, but work side by side with Steve Hadley and others at the National Security Council, to give the president the best support possible and to help implement new approaches in both Iraq and Afghanistan,'' Mr. Johndroe added.</p>
        <p>Senators also focused their questions on past comments from General Lute that expressed skepticism that the solution in Iraq required increasing the number of American troops -- which is exactly what was ordered by President Bush as part of his new strategy, announced in January.</p>
        <p>General Lute is representative of a group of officers that worked at the military's Central Command under Gen. John P. Abizaid, now retired, who argued that a large American presence was like a virus in Iraq, with more troops adding to a sense of occupation and thrusting the Iraqis into a relationship of dependency.</p>
        <p>''I think as a military planner and an operations officer, skepticism is a bit of a genetic setting,'' General Lute said in acknowledging that he had voiced reservations about the troop increase, but only if the military alone would be called upon to win the war effort.</p>
        <p>''We have taken steps on other dimensions inside the U.S. government, and the Iraqi government has taken some steps to demonstrate that it understands that it must surge, if you will, alongside of us,'' the general said.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, spoke for the Democrats on the panel in questioning the wisdom and effectiveness of the new Iraq strategy ordered by President Bush. Senator Levin noted that despite the arrival in Iraq of the increased complement of troops ordered by the president, the results ''are not very promising'' and that ''progress is not apparent in that all-important area of political reconciliation.''</p>
        <p>General Lute also acknowledged doubts about the ability of the new Iraqi government to control its own affairs, and said he had concerns whether the government in Baghdad could make good on promises of political progress, regardless of pressure from the United States government.</p>
        <p>''The question, in my mind, is not to what extent can we force them or lever them to a particular outcome, but rather to what degree do they actually have the capacity themselves to produce that outcome, and if produced -- or if pressed too hard, will we in turn end up with an outcome that isn't really worth the paper it's written on?'' General Lute said.</p>
