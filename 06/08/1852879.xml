        <p>Paraiso del Mar</p>
        <p>WHAT -- Oceanfront residential resort.  WHERE -- La Paz, Mexico.  AMENITIES -- Beach access and golf courses, among others.  PRICES -- Various residences from around $200,000 to more than $1 million.  STATUS -- The first residences are planned to be completed around the end of this year.  DEVELOPERS -- Gran Vision and the Fair Companies.  CONTACT -- (888) 201-2825 or www.paradiseofthesea.com.  DETAILS -- This 1,700-acre project on the Sea of Cortez will cover a peninsula across a bay from the center of La Paz, the capital of Baja California Sur state. When complete -- in about 10 years -- it will comprise neighborhoods with about 2,200 condominiums and 1,600 houses. The first part of its construction will include 91 two- and three-bedroom houses and 204 two- to four-bedroom condos; a rental program will be offered. Also part of the initial construction are an 18-hole Arthur Hills golf course, a marina, restaurants, a central plaza and a church. Hotels, a second golf course, a spa and a fitness center are planned for the future. Additional amenities include swimming pools, tennis courts, hiking trails and a beach club on the project's five miles of beachfront. Nearly half the property will remain undeveloped. Flights connect La Paz with Los Angeles, and the airport in Cabo San Lucas, about two hours away, has service from New York and elsewhere.</p>
