        <p>A Palestinian man was killed and at least nine other people were wounded in factional fighting in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah. Each of the rival factions, Hamas and Fatah, blamed the other for starting the shooting. The dead man belonged to Fatah. A report this week by the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights said 616 Palestinians had been killed in internal fighting since the beginning of 2006. In the first half of May, fierce factional clashes left about 50 dead in Gaza. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, warned this week that the Palestinians were ''on the verge of civil war.''</p>
