        <p>An article in some copies on Wednesday about a shootout in New Brunswick, N.J., in which a 21-year-old man was killed and a police officer was wounded gave an erroneous surname from the police for the dead man. He was Sixto Martinez, not Hernandez. The article also misspelled the surname of a neighbor of Mr. Martinez's who said she heard shots fired but thought they were firecrackers. She is Daniela Tamarez, not Taniarez.</p>
