        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Passion of Al Gore,'' by Bob Herbert (column, June 5):</p>
        <p>The Democrats have an admirable field of presidential candidates, but with one move Al Gore could level the playing field.</p>
        <p>Experience matters, and the former vice president has the most at the highest level.</p>
        <p>I could understand if Mr. Gore chose not to run, but I would be one of countless others who would be disappointed if he didn't take the risk.</p>
        <p>Jon Hunt  Old Greenwich, Conn., June 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Former Vice President Al Gore is probably right: he's not much good at politics. The current administration, on the other hand, excels at politics.</p>
        <p>Perhaps in his conversation with Bob Herbert, Mr. Gore has inadvertently suggested what should be a test for those considering a run for the presidency.</p>
        <p>Politics is a game of trivial and superficial pursuits, while governing is a serious business, best left to those with hearts and minds. What a better place the United States would be in now if someone were in office who actually thought about the consequences of his actions and possessed a conscience about the pain his actions might cause.</p>
