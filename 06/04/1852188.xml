        <p>Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, plans to stand the Kentucky Derby winner at stallion when his racing career is over.</p>

        <p>Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum's breeding operation has bought the breeding rights of the Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense and will stand him at a farm in Kentucky when his racing career is over.</p>
        <p>Darley America, the United States arm of the breeding operation, also bought the breeding rights to Hard Spun, who finished second in the Derby and third in the Preakness Stakes.</p>
        <p>''Street Sense and Hard Spun are the two most thrilling horses of their generation, each blessed with remarkable, exceptional gifts,'' Dan Pride, chief executive of Darley America, said in a statement posted on the farm's Web site.</p>
        <p>''They've achieved so much, and impressed so much, both in victory and also in defeat. It will be an enormous privilege to take charge of their stud careers. They are both so deeply talented that it's easy to see how they could each leave a lasting impression on the breed.''</p>
        <p>The two colts will join 11 stallions, including Street Sense's father, Street Cry, at Jonabell Farm in Lexington, Ky. Sheik Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, has more than 4,000 acres in the bluegrass of Kentucky, where he has aggressively stepped up his breeding operation for many reasons, not the least of which is to win the Derby.</p>
        <p>Neither horse is expected to retire until after its 3-year-old campaign. Hard Spun will race in the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. Street Sense, beaten by a head by Curlin in the Preakness, will not race again until August. His trainer, Carl Nafzger, says the colt's next race will be the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. He will also run in the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic in October at Monmouth Park in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Pride, Nafzger and Street Sense's owner, Jim Tafel, did not return telephone calls.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt that Sheik Mohammed paid generously for Street Sense. Last year, his representatives offered $17 million to the owner of Nobiz Like Shobiz, Elizabeth Valando, after his first race. She turned him down.</p>
        <p>Tafel also had overtures from the sheik to purchase Street Sense as a 2-year-old.</p>
        <p>In addition to Street Cry, Darley America owns the colt's mother, Bedazzle, having paid an undisclosed amount for her from a group that included Nafzger.</p>
        <p>Not only is Street Sense an impeccably bred Derby winner, but he was also named the 2-year-old male champion last year after a runaway victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. He commanded a premium, much like Smarty Jones, the last Derby winner retired to stud. Smarty Jones was undefeated before losing for the first time in the Belmont.</p>
        <p>Smarty Jones's owners, Roy and Pat Chapman, sold 50 percent of his breeding rights for more than $20 million to Three Chimneys Farm.</p>
