        <p>Two prominent prostate cancer experts have received threats because of their opposition to approval of a new drug, officials attending the conference of the the American Society of Clinical Oncology said Sunday.</p>
        <p>The experts, Dr. Howard I. Scher of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Dr. Maha Hussain of the University of Michigan, received e-mail and other threats, spokeswomen for Sloan-Kettering and for the cancer conference said.</p>
        <p>It is not known who sent the threats. But the doctors' public stance against the drug, Provenge, has angered some men with prostate cancer and patient advocates.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the association said it had been working with the doctors and was increasing security.</p>
