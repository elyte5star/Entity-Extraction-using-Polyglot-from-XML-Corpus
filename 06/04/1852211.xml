        <p>''Warren would break out that coat and it would be a tremendous morale booster,'' he said. ''It was time to not just enjoy the fact that you were going to get to go home, but now was the time to get anything you had left to do accomplished. It was one small symbolic way of how he was an enormously effective leader.''</p>
