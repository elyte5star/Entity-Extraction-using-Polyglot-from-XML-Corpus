        <p>Last Thursday, Nielsen Media Research began releasing standardized information about viewership of commercials. The numbers came as a relief to television executives, showing that viewers who own DVRs do not fast-forward through the ads as much as had been feared.</p>
        <p>Even if they did not confirm the industry's worst expectations, however, the numbers still showed that DVR ownership affected ad viewing. For example, among all 18- to 49-year-olds who watched the real-time broadcast of ''The Office'' on May 10, about 249,000 people did not tune into the commercials, a 6.2 percent drop-off in viewership.</p>

        <p>Even if they did not confirm the industry's worst expectations, however, the numbers still showed that DVR ownership affected ad viewing. For example, among all 18- to 49-year-olds who watched the real-time broadcast of ''The Office'' on May 10, about 249,000 people did not tune into the commercials, a 6.2 percent drop-off in viewership.</p>
        <p>But in households that owned a DVR, commercials were skipped by 50.9 percent of those who watched the show, a figure that counts both live viewers and those who watched the show up to a week after its broadcast.</p>
        <p>Over all, in the first week of May, the proportion of viewers who stuck around for TV commercials was 69.9 percent among 18- to 49-year-olds in households with DVRs, 24 percentage points lower than it was for real-time viewers that age in all households.</p>
        <p>''I don't think people were shocked,'' said Brad Adgate, senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, an ad-buying agency. ''I think the industry was hanging its hat on 70 percent at some point,'' as the proportion of DVR viewers who watched commercials.</p>
