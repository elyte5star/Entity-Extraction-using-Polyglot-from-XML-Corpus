        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-11</p>
        <p>Push for Baghdad Is Short Of Goal, Commanders Say  Three months after the start of the Baghdad security plan that has added thousands of American and Iraqi troops, they control fewer than one-third of the city's neighborhoods, far short of the initial goal, according to some commanders and an internal military assessment.  A1</p>
        <p>Pakistan Exile Talks of Return  Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is stirring up Pakistani politics by talking of a power-sharing deal with the president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and, in an interview, of returning to Pakistan before the end of the year. A1</p>
        <p>Lebanon Fears Spread of Battle  The shelling and sniper fire in a refugee camp in northern Lebanon intensified and fighting broke out between militants and the army in another camp in the south, increasing fears that the two-week battle between the Lebanese Army and Islamist militants could spread.  A3</p>
        <p>Senegal Party Boycotts Vote  Voters in Senegal largely stayed home from an election to choose a new national assembly amid widespread apathy. The main opposition parties had also called for a boycott of the election. A7</p>
        <p>Somali Premier Unhurt by Bomb  A suicide bomber narrowly missed killing Somalia's transitional prime minister, Ali Mohamed Gedi, after he rammed a pickup truck packed with explosives into the gates of his home. The explosion killed six bodyguards, along with a student at a Koranic school across the street. A7</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A12-16</p>
        <p>Ethiopia's New Popularity For American Adoptions  Ethiopia now ranks fifth among countries for adoption by Americans, up from 16th in 2000. The growing interest in Ethiopia comes at a time when the leading countries for international adoption -- China, Guatemala, and Russia -- are closing the borders to American agencies.</p>

        <p>Mitt Romney's Former Career  Mitt Romney's past success at Bain Capital, one of the nation's five largest private equity firms, helped to finance his Massachusetts campaigns and has become a cornerstone of his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain, facing increasing anger from fellow Republicans over his support of the immigration bill in Congress, is ramping up his counterattack against his main rival in the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney, by accusing him of ''pandering for votes'' in opposing the measure.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Kevorkian, Unbowed  Jack Kevorkian, the former pathologist once known as Doctor Death, says he will never again counsel a terminally ill person on how to die. But eight years behind bars and a strict list of promises to gain parole have done nothing to mellow the advocate for assisted suicide.</p>

        <p>New Liver Cancer Drug  A drug that extends the lives of patients by almost three months looks poised to become the first effective treatment for liver cancer, one of the most common and deadly.  A14</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-5</p>
        <p>As Face of Gun Control, Bloomberg Attracts Ire  In towns across the country, Michael R. Bloomberg has emerged as the face of gun control, due to his guidance of a coalition called Mayors Against Illegal Guns. In doing so, he has fueled the ire of gun rights groups, many of which contend that the coalition is trying to undermine a constitutionally protected right to bear arms. A1</p>
        <p>Filing Suggests Amateur Plot  A reading of the formal criminal complaint filed by authorities against a New York man and three others charged in a plot to bomb Kennedy International Airport suggests a less than fully mature terror plan -- a proposed effort longer on evil intent than on operational capability. B1</p>
        <p>Increase in Births to Mexicans  A new analysis by demographers shows a 28 percent increase in births to Mexican-born women in New York City between 2000 and 2005.  B1</p>
