        <p>'Gone With the Wind' Goes Musical in London</p>
        <p>When April rolls around, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Melanie and Ashley Wilkes should be singing and dancing at the New London Theater in the London's West End under the direction of Trevor Nunn in a musical adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1936 novel, ''Gone With the Wind.'' Music and lyrics will be by a newcomer, Margaret Martin, in her first work for musical theater; she is a sociologist by training and is working on two new plays. In a statement Mr. Nunn, former artistic director and chief executive of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said, ''Having now worked on adapting two vast novels for the stage, 'Nicholas Nickleby' and 'Les Misérables,' I am drawn to the challenge of telling Margaret Mitchell's epic story through words, music and the imaginative resources of the theater.'' The musical adaptation of ''Gone With the Wind'' will not be London's first; a version with a score by Harold Rome played at the Theater Royal Drury Lane in 1972.</p>
        <p>'Pirates' Sails On</p>
        <p>Treasure beyond the wildest dreams of Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Jean Lafitte or any other brigand who ever sailed the seven seas continued to swell the coffers of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' on its second weekend in North American theaters. The swashbuckler starring Johnny Depp, right, and distributed under the Buena Vista flag, amassed an estimated $43.1 million to continue as the No. 1 film, according to the box-office tracking company Media by Numbers, bringing its domestic total to $216.5 million (although the weekend gross from 4,362 theaters, the same number as last week, represented a 62 percent falloff from the preceding week). Second place in the rankings went to a newcomer: ''Knocked Up'' (Universal), the Judd Apatow pregnancy comedy starring Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, attracted $29.2 million. Third place rewarded another of the season's sequels, ''Shrek the Third'' (Paramount), which grossed $26.7 million to bring its total to $254.6 million in its third week in theaters. ''Mr. Brooks'' (MGM), starring Kevin Costner as a serial killer, took in $10 million to capture fourth place. Fifth place was occupied by yet another big-budget sequel, ''Spider-Man 3'' (Sony), which gathered $7.5 million for a five-week total of $318.2 million.</p>
        <p>Ford's Theater Renovations</p>
        <p>Ford's Theater in Washington, where Lincoln was shot, has been closed by the National Park Service for 18 months, The Associated Press reported. The closing will permit an $8.5 million renovation of the 144-year-old theater, including its first elevator, new restrooms, and improvements in its heating, air conditioning, lighting and sound systems, in part to improve access for the disabled. The theater was last renovated in the 1960s.</p>
        <p>'West Side Story' Goes Gold</p>
        <p>A 50th-anniversary production of ''West Side Story'' will be presented at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for four weeks beginning on Nov. 20. The show will be performed in English by an American cast. On Friday the North Carolina School of the Arts production of ''West Side Story,'' which grossed $940,000 in Winston-Salem and drew more than 15,000 people in a dozen performances last month, will play the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill., a Chicago suburb.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Bobby Short may be gone, but he's not forgotten. Beginning tomorrow night, Michael Feinstein and a succession of special guests will pay tribute to that sophisticated singer and pianist with ''Celebrating Bobby Short'' through June 16 at Feinstein's at Loews Regency. The leadoff guest will be Elaine Stritch. On June 12, Liza Minnelli is to join the entertainment. Kevin Spacey and Vanessa Redgrave, along with performers from ''Frost/Nixon,'' ''Grey Gardens,'' ''Hairspray,'' ''Inherit the Wind,'' ''Jersey Boys,'' ''Legally Blonde,'' ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''Spring Awakening,'' are scheduled to appear on Wednesday at ''Stars in the Alley.'' The free outdoor concert, from 11 a.m. to about 12:30 p.m. in Shubert Alley, west of Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, celebrates the 2006-7 Broadway season. The eminent jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, 82, will be saluted Friday at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall in a ''Master of Swing'' concert featuring Dee Dee Bridgewater, Paquito D'Rivera, Jimmy Heath, Marian McPartland, Billy Taylor and Clark Terry, among many others. Free outdoor movies will return to Bryant Park for a 15th season at sunset on June 18 with a presentation of Woody Allen's ''Annie Hall'' on a 20-by-40-foot screen. The screenings, every Monday night through Aug. 20, will include ''Paper Moon'' (July 2), ''The Sting'' (July 23) and ''Casablanca'' (Aug. 13).

        <p>Correction:  June 5, 2007, Tuesday  A report in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column yesterday about the tribute ''Celebrating Bobby Short,'' at Feinstein's at Loews Regency through June 16, misidentified a performer who will take part on June 12. It will be Wynton Marsalis -- not Liza Minnelli, who had been scheduled to perform earlier but will not be taking part.</p>
