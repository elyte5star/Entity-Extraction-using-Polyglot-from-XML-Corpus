        <p>KELLER--Adelaide. The beloved wife of George for 60 years; mother of Bill, Bob and Barry; grandmother to Anna, Matt, Danny, Tom, Molly and Alice; sister of William T. McCague and mother-in-law to Maureen, Lynda and Emma passed away peacefully at the age of 84 just after midnight on Saturday, June 2nd at Sequoia Hospital, Redwoods City, California. Addie was a lover of mystery novels, golf and orchids, an enthusiastic amateur poet and a columnist for several local newsletters. But she will be best remembered as a devoted philanthropist who gave generously to her alma mater Wellesley College, to San Mateo County Hospital and to many other charitable organizations in and around San Mateo where she lived. She won multiple awards for her generosity in the Bay Area including an official recognition by the US House of Representatives in 1993. In 1970 she co-founded the Women's Recovery Association -the nations first residential treatment program for female recovering alcoholics. For several years she was a board member of the San Mateo County Medical Center for which she was a champion fund raiser, creating its annual bed race and parade. But she was always happier offering her services at the grassroots level rather than serving on boards and her legacy can be seen most clearly in The Keller Center for Family Violence Intervention. The Center opened in 2001 because of Addie's strong belief that something more needed to be done to break the pattern of domestic violence. Emphasizing both crisis intervention and communitybased education and prevention the Center was based at the San Mateo County Medical Center, but worked closely with local law enforcement and judicial agencies. In lieu of flowers, donations in her name can be made to the Keller Center for Family Violence at San Mateo County Medical Center.</p>
