        <p>9 P.M. (Lifetime) WRITE &amp; WRONG -- (2007) Kirstie Alley can't seem to get a break. As if the fat-actress self-flagellation weren't bad enough, Ms. Alley, now slender, is encountering the pitfalls of middle age in this made-for-television comedy about a 40-something screenwriter who can no longer get a lunch in Hollywood -- until she starts passing off her scripts as the work of her hunky young nephew (Eric Christian Olsen, with Ms. Alley above). When he falls in love with a studio executive, Auntie's plan to reveal her true talents may never see the light of day.</p>
        <p>7:30 P.M. (Sundance) THE LAST VICTORY -- (2004) In Siena, Italy, the Palio horse race, a bareback scramble around the main square, has been an annual source of glory for one of the city's 17 districts for centuries. In this colorful documentary John Appel homes in on the pageantry, feasts, flag waving and fisticuffs surrounding the mad 80-second dash and examines the efforts of Civetta, Siena's smallest district, which hasn't won since 1979.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) CREATURE COMFORTS -- Animal magnetism indeed. Aardman Animations of ''Wallace &amp; Gromit'' fame has adapted its own British series. In the new version, which makes its debut tonight, ordinary Americans lend their voices to a menagerie of creatures, like the lovebirds at left, who discuss things like height differences, attracting the opposite sex, visits to the doctor and difficulties of keeping secrets.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Bravo) INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO -- Yada, yada, yada: Julia Louis-Dreyfus talks about her stint on ''Saturday Night Live,'' her experiences on ''Seinfeld'' and surviving the Seinfeld curse.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (TLC) LITTLE PEOPLE, BIG WORLD -- Two back-to-back episodes focus on surgery to repair Zach's bowed legs, followed by a cheer-up visit from the actor and stunt man Martin Klebba, also a little person.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) EX-WIVES CLUB -- Marla Maples, Angie Everhart and Shar Jackson help a military veteran from Orlando, Fla., and a nanny in Schenectady, N.Y., rebuild their lives after devastating breakups.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) HELL'S KITCHEN -- Sharpen your knives and get out the fire extinguisher. The hot-headed Gordon Ramsay, right, dishes up new servings of fury to 12 contestants competing for the post of head chef of an Italian restaurant at the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa in Las Vegas in this reality competition's third season.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (WE) PARK CITY MUSIC -- Joss Stone, Johnny Lang, Joan Osborne, Lindsey Buckingham, Kenneth (Babyface) Edmonds and Daniel Powter perform in this hourlong special recorded during four nights at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.</p>
