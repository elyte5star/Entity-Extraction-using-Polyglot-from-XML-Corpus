        <p>The military wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for firing mortar shells at the Erez crossing on the Gaza-Israel border on Sunday, slightly wounding four Israeli soldiers, hours after Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man in the West Bank city of Jenin.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman said that Palestinian gunmen had opened fire on the soldiers in Jenin, and that the man who was hit earlier was armed. Palestinian reports identified him as Muhammad Farahati, 22, a militant affiliated with both the pro-Fatah Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades militia and the group Islamic Jihad.</p>
        <p>In a tactical shift, Hamas stopped firing Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel a few days ago, according to a person close to the organization's military wing who asked not to be identified. He said Hamas was aiming its fire at the Gaza-Israel border and Israeli military posts, instead of at civilian centers like the Israeli border town of Sderot.</p>
        <p>Hamas is demanding that any renewed truce with Israel must be applied simultaneously to the West Bank. The military wing said that Sunday's mortar shells had been a response to ''Zionist aggression'' against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, Israeli soldiers shot and killed another Palestinian man in the West Bank city of Nablus. The army spokesman said the man had been armed.</p>
        <p>Hostilities between Gaza and Israel flared in mid-May after Hamas, the Islamist faction that dominates the Palestinian government, announced that it was resuming rocket fire against Israel after a six-month lull. That was followed by two weeks of intense rocket fire and an Israeli air campaign against military compounds and posts in Gaza, mostly belonging to Hamas.</p>
        <p>Sunday started out as the quietest day since the escalation began, with just the firing of the mortar shells, no rockets fired and no Israeli airstrikes by sundown. On Friday and Saturday, a total of nine rockets were launched by smaller Palestinian factions. At least five landed in Israeli territory, according to the army.</p>
        <p>In mid-May, at the peak of the rocket fire, nearly 40 Qassams were launched in one day.</p>
        <p>At the opening of Sunday's cabinet meeting, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said, ''With regard to what appears to be a reduction in the Qassam fire, I should like to clarify: We are not negotiating, nor do we undertake to change our modus operandi.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Olmert said security services would continue to act both in Gaza and in the West Bank. The military actions have ''produced results,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator and a close aide of President Mahmoud Abbas, of Fatah, said Israel's actions in the West Bank had been ''undermining the chances'' of reaching a new cease-fire. ''We are asking for a mutual cessation of hostilities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erekat also accused Israel of a ''policy of political blindness,'' a reference to its forces killing or arresting a number of West Bank Palestinians affiliated with Fatah's military wing in recent days. On Tuesday, Israel arrested a Fatah lawmaker, Jamal Tirawi, from Nablus.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Winograd Committee, which investigated the Israeli government's actions during last summer's war in Lebanon, released a censored version of the testimony of Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni.</p>
        <p>The government-appointed committee published a partial report in late April accusing the political and military leadership of severe failures, after which Ms. Livni called on the prime minister to resign.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Livni did not resign, arguing that she had come out of the report unscathed. As a result, an attempt by Kadima party colleagues to replace Mr. Olmert with Ms. Livni quickly fizzled out.</p>
        <p>In her testimony, Ms. Livni said that on July 12, the day the war started, she thought that Israel had embarked on a military operation that would end the same night, or at the latest, by noon the next day. The war, which followed the seizure of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization, lasted 34 days.</p>
        <p>Ms. Livni told the Winograd panel that she had been pushing Mr. Olmert to focus on a diplomatic exit strategy from July 13 on, but that he told her to ''calm down,'' put off meeting with her in private, and seemed inattentive when she spoke of the need for a diplomatic process in cabinet meetings. The war eventually ended with a cease-fire brokered by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olmert has denied that Ms. Livni tried to bring the war to an early end. A censored version of his testimony was released in May.</p>
        <p>Threats to Women on TV Protested  By The New York Times</p>
        <p>GAZA CITY, June 3 -- About 50 employees of the official Palestinian Authority television station demonstrated in Gaza City on Sunday, protesting threats to its female anchors from a radical Islamic organization calling itself Swords of Truth.</p>
        <p>The shadowy group issued a statement criticizing the women for wearing makeup and not wearing veils, as many religious Muslim women do. The organization said their behavior was immodest and was ''destroying the Islamic culture.''</p>
        <p>Muhammad Daoudi, who is in charge of Palestinian Authority TV, said the protest was meant to send ''a message of anger and condemnation.'' Almost 300 women and 350 men work for the station, he said.</p>
        <p>Many of the women at the demonstration covered up with head scarves, contrary to their usual practice. The protesters marched to the office of President Abbas, which is next to the television building, and demanded his protection.</p>
        <p>Swords of Truth has claimed responsibility for bombing dozens of Internet cafes, music stores and other symbols of Western-style entertainment in Gaza in recent months.</p>
