        <p>The Long Island Spring Regional starts in Smithtown tomorrow. The tournament chairman, Steve Conrad of Manhasset, N.Y., played on Memorial Day weekend in the Easterns Regional in New York City. He and his teammates, Diana Schuld of Glen Head, N.Y., Ruth Stober of Great Neck, N.Y., and Michael Abramson of Montclair, N.J., finished second in the Open Swiss Teams behind Steven Petersell, Qiang Wang and Sam Wang of New York and Jian Wang of New Milford, N.J. They might have been third but for the diagramed deal.</p>
        <p>North's three-heart cue-bid showed at least a limit raise with three or more spades. This was an overbid. If you count support points (high-card points plus shortage points), this hand contains only nine, not the 10-12 promised. If, like me, you are an acolyte of the Losing Trick Count, North showed at most eight losers, but this hand has nine-and-a-half: three spades, three hearts, one-and-a-half diamonds and two clubs.</p>

        <p>The Long Island Spring Regional starts in Smithtown tomorrow. The tournament chairman, Steve Conrad of Manhasset, N.Y., played on Memorial Day weekend in the Easterns Regional in New York City. He and his teammates, Diana Schuld of Glen Head, N.Y., Ruth Stober of Great Neck, N.Y., and Michael Abramson of Montclair, N.J., finished second in the Open Swiss Teams behind Steven Petersell, Qiang Wang and Sam Wang of New York and Jian Wang of New Milford, N.J. They might have been third but for the diagramed deal.</p>
        <p>North's three-heart cue-bid showed at least a limit raise with three or more spades. This was an overbid. If you count support points (high-card points plus shortage points), this hand contains only nine, not the 10-12 promised. If, like me, you are an acolyte of the Losing Trick Count, North showed at most eight losers, but this hand has nine-and-a-half: three spades, three hearts, one-and-a-half diamonds and two clubs.</p>
        <p>Here, though, if North had settled for two spades, the value of his hand, South would have made a game try, which North would have accepted.</p>
        <p>Note also that South might have rebid three no-trump, a contract that has nine top tricks.</p>
        <p>Against four spades West led his club queen. Conrad (South) could see that if the diamond finesse was working, he had overtricks in his future. But if it lost, East would shift to a heart, and the defenders would surely take one diamond and three hearts to defeat the contract. East had to be kept off the lead.</p>
        <p>To help achieve this aim, declarer let West hold the first trick, which is the only winning play.</p>
        <p>South took the club continuation with his ace, played two rounds of trumps ending on the board, discarded a diamond on the club king, cashed the diamond ace and called for the diamond jack.</p>
        <p>If East had played low, declarer was going to discard a heart. Even if West could have won the trick, the contract would have been safe. South would have lost at most one heart, one diamond and one club.</p>
        <p>But when East covered with the diamond king, declarer ruffed, went to dummy with a trump and cashed the last two diamonds to collect an overtrick. He took six spades, three diamonds and two clubs.</p>
        <p>At the other table declarer took a simple diamond finesse and lost four red-suit tricks to go down one.</p>
        <p>Plus 650 and plus 100 was worth 13 international match points.</p>
        <p>Finally note that defeating four spades is easy if West leads a diamond. But it can also be done if West opens with his trump. Suppose declarer wins the trick on the board and calls for a club. East must cover the three with his seven or the eight with his nine. (Otherwise South ducks the trick to West.) If East is allowed to win this trick, he shifts to the heart jack. Or if declarer wins with his ace, West must unblock an honor. Now South cannot discard a diamond on a club without letting East on lead for the killing heart-jack switch.</p>
        <p>Any pair who managed that would deserve the International Bridge Press Association's award for the best defense of the year.</p>
        <p>In the trials to pick three United States teams for the world championships, the women's event moved into the semifinals yesterday. The Hansa Narasimhan team played against the team led by Shawn Quinn, and Lynn Baker's team faced Kathleen Sulgrove's. The open event completed the second round robin yesterday, and 9 of the 16 teams started their Round of 16 matches. Full details can be found at usbf.org.</p>
