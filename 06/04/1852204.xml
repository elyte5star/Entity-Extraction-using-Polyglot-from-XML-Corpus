        <p>Because of an editing error, two picture captions on Tuesday with an article in Science Times about private rooms in neonatal intensive care units misspelled the surname of a woman whose son was born prematurely in St. Paul. She is Robyn Frandrup, not Frandrep. Also, the article misstated the month that Amillia Taylor, who was born at just over 21 weeks' gestation, was released from a Miami hospital. It was February, not April.</p>
