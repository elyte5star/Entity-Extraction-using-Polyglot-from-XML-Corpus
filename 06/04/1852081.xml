        <p>KANE--Lester P. He was a giant in court reporting who single handedly transformed his profession. A devoted husband, father and grandfather, and art connoisseur bon vivant, meticulous in everything, he enriched the lives of all he touched. We mourn with his wife Libby, his children Nancy (Amanda), Robert (Lee), Richard and Claudia and their spouses and children. You will never be forgotten. ''We feel very stronly about that''.
