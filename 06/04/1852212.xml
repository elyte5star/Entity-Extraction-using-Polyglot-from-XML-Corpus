        <p>Her long blond ponytail soaked with sweat, Maria Sharapova stood at midcourt Sunday, smiling and blowing kisses to the crowd booing her.</p>
        <p>The stadium rumbled with jeers as she defeated Patty Schnyder in a tense fourth-round match, 3-6, 6-4, 9-7.

        <p>Her long blond ponytail soaked with sweat, Maria Sharapova stood at midcourt Sunday, smiling and blowing kisses to the crowd booing her.</p>
        <p>The stadium rumbled with jeers as she defeated Patty Schnyder in a tense fourth-round match, 3-6, 6-4, 9-7. Sharapova struck the ball with unrelenting power for 2 hours 37 minutes, eventually saving two match points. Still, the fans, reacting to what they perceived to be an earlier moment of poor sportsmanship, seemed to see nothing but a villain in a blue clingy tennis dress.</p>
        <p>''It's tough playing tennis and being Mother Teresa at the same time and making everyone happy,'' Sharapova said, unemotionally, after the match.</p>
        <p>The second-seeded Sharapova advanced to the French Open quarterfinals for the third time in her career. She has never made it past that round. She will play No. 9-seeded Anna Chakvetadze, who defeated No. 25 Lucie Safarova in three sets Sunday.</p>
        <p>By then, the fans may have settled down. On Sunday, even Schnyder failed to persuade the audience to quell its anger. As the spectators booed, she lifted her right index finger to her lips, to try to hush them. But her effort was useless.</p>
        <p>In the third set, those catcalls had reached ear-splitting decibels. As Sharapova was serving with the score 7-7, 30-love, a fan shouted. Rattled, Schnyder had lifted her hand to indicate that she was not ready, but the serve had already landed on her side of the net. When the umpire refused to replay the point, and Sharapova did not offer to do so, the crowd erupted.</p>
        <p>Sharapova said she never considered offering to replay that point, considering the closeness of the match. Later, Schnyder did not complain.</p>
        <p>''I was distracted, and it was the public's choice to do it; I didn't boo,'' Schnyder said. ''I think we should appreciate the champion she is.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''At the end, she was the big champion. I'm the little one who could not win.''</p>
        <p>Schnyder, who is ranked 15th in the world, ended the match with a forehand that flew wide. On the opposite side of the court, Sharapova buried her face in her hands, as emotions washed over her.</p>
        <p>She held her fist to her chest as she looked around the stands, seemingly deaf to the crowd's angry roars. Though she looked on the verge of tears, she denied it later, saying she was simply grateful to have won.</p>
        <p>In other fourth-round matches Sunday, Roger Federer, the world's No. 1 men's player, defeated Mikhail Youzhny for the 10th time in a row, 7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-4. Federer will play ninth-seeded Tommy Robredo in the quarterfinals. Nikolay Davydenko, seeded fourth, also advanced and will play No. 19 Guillermo Cañas.</p>
        <p>On the women's side, No. 1 Justine Henin and No. 8 Serena Williams both won their matches, setting up a rematch of the 2003 semifinal here. That match four years ago was similar to Sharapova's match Sunday.</p>
        <p>There was jeering and a disputed call for time that added to the intensity of a crowd that was already on Henin's side. Williams left the court in tears. Henin left with her first Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>But much has changed since that emotionally charged match, which signified the best moment of Henin's career and the worst of Williams's. Both say they have matured since then.</p>
        <p>''I've been through death,'' Williams said. ''I had surgery I think since then. I've been through a lot.''</p>
        <p>Williams, the 2002 French Open champion, said she had become more cynical since 2003. Her half-sister Yetunde Price was murdered that year. Also, left-knee problems resulted in surgery and have plagued her career. Last year, Williams nearly fell out of the top 100 because of those injuries.</p>
        <p>This year, though, she came back to win the Australian Open, ranked 81st.</p>
        <p>''It takes a strong person to be at the bottom of the barrel,'' said Williams, 25. ''I was really down there, and it's hard to be able to come back, especially when everyone seems against you and you have so many doubters.''</p>
        <p>Henin has changed in completely different ways. She has gone from aloof to outgoing. After her 6-2, 6-4 victory against No. 20 Sybille Bammer on Sunday, she turned to the crowd and even giggled as she soaked up the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Henin had been a loner on the women's tour. There were reasons for that. Her mother died of cancer when Henin was 12. Afterward, Henin distanced herself from her father and three siblings to make a life on her own.</p>
        <p>But since separating from her husband, Pierre-Yves Hardenne, late last year, Henin has begun to emerge from behind the wall she had built around her. She said that two weeks ago she restored contact with her estranged father and siblings, whom she had not spoken with in years, calling it ''a lot of joy.''</p>
        <p>''I just tried to become a better person,'' said Henin, 25, who added: ''I want to get more concerned, more involved, and a lot of things have changed. I feel much better about myself.''</p>
        <p>Henin said that she and Williams had not discussed that stressful 2003 semifinal. But both players have one thing in common: they want to forget that conflict.</p>
        <p>They played a final in Miami in March without incident. Williams won in three sets. ''I let it go, and obviously she did,'' Williams said. ''Or whether she did or not, it doesn't matter anymore. This is a new year.''</p>
