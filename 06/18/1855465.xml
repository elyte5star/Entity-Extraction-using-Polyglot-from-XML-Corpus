        <p>A driver lost control of his livery cab on Flatbush Avenue yesterday afternoon and drove onto the sidewalk, striking two teenage boys and a man, the police said. The accident occurred at 3:20 p.m. on the northbound side of Flatbush at East 29th Street. One teenager, 15, was taken to Kings County Hospital Center in extremely critical condition, the police said. A man with him, whose age was unknown, was in critical condition at the same hospital, while a 16-year-old was in critical condition at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, the police said. Alcohol was not a factor in the accident, and the driver was not charged yesterday afternoon, the police said. Neither the driver nor a passenger in the car was seriously injured.</p>
