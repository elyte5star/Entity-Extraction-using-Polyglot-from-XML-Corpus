        <p>10 P.M. (NBC) DATELINE NBC -- This summer is the 10th anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the usually reticent Princes William, 24, and Harry, 22, are speaking out. They discuss the tribute concert for their mother and their lives since her death, as well as their memories of her, with Matt Lauer (above right, with Princes Harry, left, and William).</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) DEAL OR NO DEAL -- Laurel Martin, a preschool teacher from St. Louis (above, with the host, Howie Mandel), may be banking on the support she will receive from her 18-member family in tonight's season finale as she plays for the top prize of $1 million. But this action-movie fanatic may have a lethal weapon on her side that she wasn't expecting. Viewers will have a chance to win $50,000 in the ''Play at Home Lucky Case Game.''</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) AGE OF LOVE -- In this new reality show the Australian tennis star Mark Philippoussis, 30, looks for love in a field of 13 women: 6 from the ''kitten'' group who are all in their 20s and 7 ''cougars'' who are in their 40s. Who will he chose? Hard to say -- even he doesn't know about the age conceit at first. Mark Consuelos is host.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13), (49) SIMON SCHAMA'S POWER OF ART -- Art is meant to shake things up, and Mr. Schama (left), art scholar and writer, uses this series to explore some of the most subversive and/or troubled figures in the field, starting with van Gogh. At 10 p.m., Picasso takes the spotlight.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TNT) THE CLOSER -- She's back, and in the series premiere Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) and her team are investigating the murder of a family whose only remaining member is the prime suspect. And with budget cuts looming, she either has to give up a member of her team or force Lieutenant Provenza to retire early.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (LOGO) CURL GIRLS -- This series chronicles the lives of six women, lovers and friends, and their common obsession: surfing. In the premiere episode Jessica and Melissa collide mid-wave, leading them to discuss their faltering relationship.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (TNT) HEARTLAND -- Dr. Nathaniel Grant (Treat Williams) is a pioneering transplant surgeon who will do whatever it takes to save his patients. He's also a father trying to balance his family life with his work life. In the premiere of this drama series Dr. Grant has to deal with a man who wants to see the patient who received his wife's heart.</p>
