        <p>DJ Khaled  ''We the Best'' (Koch)</p>
        <p>Last year the Miami hip-hop hustler DJ Khaled assembled ''Listennn'' (Koch), a legal and licensed sequel to his underground mixtapes. The overstuffed lineup was a tribute to DJ Khaled's skill as a rapper wrangler, and the CD helped cement Miami's position as one of the country's most important hip-hop cities.</p>

        <p>DJ Khaled  ''We the Best'' (Koch)</p>
        <p>Last year the Miami hip-hop hustler DJ Khaled assembled ''Listennn'' (Koch), a legal and licensed sequel to his underground mixtapes. The overstuffed lineup was a tribute to DJ Khaled's skill as a rapper wrangler, and the CD helped cement Miami's position as one of the country's most important hip-hop cities.</p>
        <p>The follow-up is ''We the Best'' (or as DJ Khaled incessantly pronounces it, ''we-da-BESSS''), a leaner and more focused compilation that has already spawned a hit: the exuberant ''We Takin' Over,'' starring Akon, T. I., Birdman, Lil Wayne, Fat Joe and Rick Ross. All you get on this CD is a bunch of big-name rappers trading verses, but for a certain kind of hip-hop fan that's plenty. ''Brown Paper Bag'' gives Juelz Santana a chance to shift from third person to first: ''The cars that he drives are all foreign/The game is mine, I'm so far in/I'm speaking with a accent -- you just cahn't win.'' And ''I'm From the Ghetto'' has a chorus of kids along with back-in-the-day verses from the Jadakiss, Trick Daddy and the Game, whose throaty reminiscence makes him the victor. (There's no way around it: Put more than two rappers on the same song, and you've got yourself a competition.)</p>
        <p>No one will confuse this CD with a classic album, but in an era when album sales are falling, maybe that's a good thing. Why couldn't an ambitious record company win customers -- maybe even subscribers -- by hiring mixtape D.J.'s and releasing a ''We the Best'' every month?</p>
