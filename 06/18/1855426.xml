      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says 39 states that elect at least some of their judges must either adopt public financing and strict fund-raising rules for judicial elections or switch to nonelective merit selection system; voices dismay that biggest spenders in 2006 judicial elections were business interests</p>

        <p>The problem of wealthy interests' trying to influence court decisions by pouring money into state judicial elections continues to escalate, according to a newly released report. So does the threat to the impartiality, independence and integrity of the nation's courts. If the courts are going to pursue justice rather than advance special-interest agendas, states must either adopt public financing and strict fund-raising rules for judicial elections or switch to a nonelective merit selection system.</p>
        <p>Thirty-nine states elect at least some of their judges. The report -- released by the Justice at Stake Campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics -- found that by 2004, the amount raised by candidates for states' highest courts had reached nearly $47 million nationwide, up from $29 million in 2002. In 2006, total fund-raising decreased to $34.4 million, largely owing to a decrease in the number of contested races. But the median amount raised by individual candidates in 2006 soared to nearly $244,000 -- from the 2004 median of about $202,000.</p>

        <p>Television ads, until recently a rarity in top-level state court races, are now the norm. Such ads ran last fall in 10 of the 11 states where such judges were up for election, compared with just 4 of 18 states in 2000. Average spending on television airtime per state was also up, much of it for 15- and 30-second attack ads. In the race for Alabama's chief justice seat, the second-most-expensive judicial race ever, 17,830 spots were run on behalf of candidates.</p>
        <p>By far the biggest spenders in the 2006 judicial elections were business interests. They contributed $15 million to the 88 state supreme court candidates who raised funds in the latest election cycle, about 44 percent of all contributions, and far more than the roughly $7 million that lawyers gave.</p>
        <p>There were a few encouraging developments. Raising the most money correlated with victory in 68 percent of judicial races in 2006, down from 85 percent in 2004. But the overall picture is bleak enough that states need to act quickly to stop special-interest money from becoming, in the words of the report, ''a permanent national campaign against impartial justice.''</p>
