        <p>If the news conference that CNN and YouTube held last week to discuss their first-of-a-kind presidential debate was any sort of omen, there might be a few kinks for the companies to work out in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>Ahead of a conference call Thursday, the companies sent the wrong dial-in number to many journalists, leaving about a dozen of them listening to dead air while colleagues call continued on another line.</p>
        <p>After the fact, there was some finger-pointing, but no official explanation of how the lines of communications had been crossed. Reporters who missed the first 15 minutes or so of the news conference could get an e-mail transcript.</p>
        <p>Those who had the correct telephone number heard senior executives from CNN and YouTube talk about the new ground rules: Ordinary folk are being invited to post videos on YouTube with questions for the candidates, and the best of the questions will be selected for a July 23 event featuring the Democrats. A similar forum for Republican candidates will be held on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>''We're confident we're providing a new outlet for them for distribution,'' said Chad Hurley, chief executive and co-founder of YouTube, a division of Google. ''We're actively working to provide them new opportunities and develop new technologies.''</p>
        <p>At the first debate, Anderson Cooper of CNN will act as a moderator and pose follow-up questions; the original pool of questions will come from the public.</p>
        <p>In the anything-goes world of YouTube, the companies expect to see creative and maybe emotional clips that will stir the audience and perhaps the candidates.</p>
        <p>CNN and YouTube say they are trying to drive political dialogue by replacing the old scripted format and putting power into the hands of everyday citizens.</p>
        <p>''This is the most democratic of all possible structures,'' said David Bohrman, senior vice president and Washington bureau chief of CNN. ''Everyone in the country has a chance of having a question asked of someone who can very possibly be the next president.''</p>
        <p>As for ironing out any possible glitches or communication problems before the debate, CNN said it was sure everything would be organized and ready.</p>
        <p>''We don't normally handle the press conferences,'' Mr. Bohrman said. ''But we are running the debates, so the audience shouldn't worry.''</p>
