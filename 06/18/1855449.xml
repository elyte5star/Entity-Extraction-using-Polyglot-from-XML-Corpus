        <p>Fashion has always been something of a uniform. Goths, hippies, preppies, Madison Avenue ladies who lunch: each group has its look.</p>
        <p>But since last week's Puerto Rican Day Parade, many previously oblivious New Yorkers are seeing the colors black and yellow the way editorial assistants at Vogue perceive little gold horse bits: as social signifiers.</p>
        <p>Just as horse bits, to fashionistas, are the universal emblem of Gucci, to law enforcement black and yellow (or gold) are the markers of the Latin Kings, a group the police consider a violent street gang. When the police arrested 208 people at the parade on June 10, all but 10 of them said to be gang members, mostly Latin Kings, the colors that some were wearing turned out to be a strike against them.</p>
        <p>For many New Yorkers, the idea of gang colors is almost quaint, an oddly old-fashioned, ''West Side Story'' way for gang members to identify themselves, as if they were trapped in the amber of a simpler era. In these days of high-tech antiterrorist and antigang intelligence, it seems almost na√Øve that a group of people being watched so closely by the police would choose to identify themselves so flagrantly.</p>
        <p>Why would the Latin Kings -- to the degree those who were arrested were Latin Kings, which is a matter of hot dispute -- choose to out themselves this way?</p>
        <p>''I think with the Kings it's defiance; it shows resistance and autonomy,'' said David Brotherton, a sociologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a co-author of ''The Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation,'' which is the full name of the national group. ''They see the world as a powerless place, and they're speaking back to power.''</p>
        <p>The Latin Kings themselves say that wearing the colors is a matter of cultural pride and identity, and little different from the Greek letters used by a fraternity or, for that matter, the blue uniforms of the New York Police Department.</p>
        <p>''When these kids go out with their bandannas and their beads and any kind of paraphernalia, even if it's colored T-shirts, they're proud of who they are,'' said Mission Ross, 27, a former New Yorker now living in Arizona who said he spoke for the national Latin Kings.</p>
        <p>Like so much of fashion coding, interpreting the meaning of gang colors is, to use a word that Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly used after the arrests, ''situational.'' A gilt bit on the bag of a woman on Canal Street may be less of a signifier of summers spent on the Riviera than one spotted on the arm of a Madison Avenue matron.</p>
        <p>The yellow and black uniforms worn by the children's soccer referees at Riverside Park may arguably be less suspicious than the yellow and black Nike sneakers that one of the youths the police accused of being a Latin King, Thomas Scull, was wearing at the Puerto Rican Day Parade when he was arrested. (Mr. Scull said yellow was his favorite color.) The Latin Kings leaders say major clothing companies have capitalized on the allure of gang colors -- not just yellow and black, but also, for instance, the red of the rival Bloods -- to market their products.</p>
        <p>Most of those arrested at the parade were charged with unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. Some contended that they had been rounded up for no reason other than the color of their clothing.</p>
        <p>And Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer who has been advising some of those arrested, said it did not matter whether they were Latin Kings.</p>
        <p>''In our criminal justice system, the premise is that you are arrested for your conduct, not for your status,'' he said at a news conference yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel also said, in an earlier interview, that it was counterintuitive to charge people with unlawful assembly at a parade, and that the unlawful assembly law was intended to prevent riots.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the police used a number of factors -- gang databases, colors, signing, chanting and ''self-describing'' -- to determine who was a gang member. But he said that the police arrested people based only on their conduct, and that a suspect's affiliation with a gang was incidental.</p>
        <p>One New York Latin King who goes by the name Almighty Sire suggested, somewhat brazenly, that what is a gang is a matter of interpretation. ''How about the Police Department?'' he said in an interview. ''They operate very much with a gang mentality, and they're the first ones to tell you, 'Your gang does not move these streets; our gang moves these streets.' ''</p>
        <p>''It creates a very dangerous setting because they all wear the same colors, they're all armed, they all have the same characteristics,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Local members of the Latin Kings, a Hispanic gang that originated in Chicago in the 1940s, say they have tried to reinvent themselves as a cultural pride organization, concerned with service to the Puerto Rican community.</p>
        <p>But the police scoff at this notion of reinvention, saying it is mostly a public relations gambit by a gang that has learned to manipulate the media in New York, the media capital of the world.</p>
        <p>In the late 1990s, Antonio Fernandez, the leader of the New York State branch of the Latin Kings, was frequently quoted as saying that he was turning the group into a Hispanic self-improvement organization. Then Mr. Fernandez, known as King Tone, was arrested with dozens of other Latin Kings members on drug trafficking charges. In 1999 he was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison for conspiring to deal cocaine and heroin.</p>
        <p>''There may be a handful of people out there that join the Latin Kings that don't want to commit crimes; I'd say it's probably less than 1 percent,'' said Lou Savelli, a retired New York City police sergeant who worked in the gangs unit.</p>
        <p>''The New York Latin Kings are probably the best-organized group in the country, better than the Chicago Latin Kings,'' he continued. ''They have cohesive chapters, meetings, and are given propaganda. They're well schooled in giving out bad information that makes them look good.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Savelli had his own interpretation of why people would wear gang colors, and it was not cultural pride. ''Most of them come from nothing: poor homes, crack-infested neighborhoods,'' he said. ''They are looking for some kind of identity.''</p>
        <p>Showing gang colors is an organizational tool, he said, a control mechanism.</p>
        <p>''Think about a city like New York,'' Sergeant Savelli said. ''Once you wear those Latin King colors, now who are you automatically visible to?</p>
        <p>''The police are No. 1. They may talk to you, stop you; they are not going to hurt you. No. 2 are your rivals, the Bloods and Crips and anybody else. No. 3 is your own gang.''</p>
        <p>Pretending to be a Latin King, Sergeant Savelli said, is dangerous because gang members will ''front'' or question that person, demanding to know details like the names of the local gang and its leader. ''If they make you as a fake gang member, the gang itself is going to hurt you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Latin Kings acknowledge that some of their members were at the parade, though Almighty Sire said that some members reported that police officers on the scene had warned them there would be arrests and advised them to tuck in their necklaces of black and gold beads.</p>
        <p>He contended that many of those arrested were innocent bystanders, or Latin King pretenders who give the group a bad name.</p>
        <p>''There are those who truly believe our five points, five principles, who practice what we believe in, and those into wearing our colors, throwing up our symbol and just cliqueing,'' he said. ''That's not what we're about, but it's very hard for us to segregate ourselves from those individuals who are like that.''</p>
