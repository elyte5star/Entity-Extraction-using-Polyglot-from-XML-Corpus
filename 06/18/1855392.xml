        <p>Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, a developer of treatments for diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, is expected to announce today that it has signed deals with two private equity firms that will invest nearly $300 million into the 12-year-old publicly held company.</p>
        <p>In the first deal, the Invus Group, based in New York, will spend $205 million this year to raise its stake in the company to 40 percent.

        <p>Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, a developer of treatments for diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, is expected to announce today that it has signed deals with two private equity firms that will invest nearly $300 million into the 12-year-old publicly held company.</p>
        <p>In the first deal, the Invus Group, based in New York, will spend $205 million this year to raise its stake in the company to 40 percent. Invus will acquire warrants to buy 16.4 million shares in Lexicon for $3.09 a share, and will buy about 20.4 million shares for $4.50, or a 46 percent premium over Friday's closing price.</p>
        <p>As of March 31, Invus held about 4.5 million shares in Lexicon.</p>
        <p>Invus will also have the right to buy up to an additional 9 percent of Lexicon stock, giving it a total of 49 percent, and can also require the company to hold two additional share sales. Lexicon will also add three seats to its eight-member board, giving Invus the new seats.</p>
        <p>In the second deal, worth $60 million, Symphony Capital Partners, a New York-based firm that specializes in biopharmaceutical products, will invest $45 million into a new company that will hold the licenses for Lexicon's first three drug candidates, including treatments for cognitive disorders and irritable bowel syndrome. Symphony will also give Lexicon $15 million for general purposes.</p>
        <p>Lexicon will have the right to acquire the new company at a price that will range from $72 million in its second year to $90 million in the fourth and final year of the agreement.</p>
        <p>Based in The Woodlands, Tex., Lexicon uses gene knockout technology in its research and has collaborated with larger industry players like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Genentech. As of Friday, its market value was $241.2 million.</p>
