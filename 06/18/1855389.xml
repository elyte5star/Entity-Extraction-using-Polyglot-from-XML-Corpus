        <p>''The Sopranos'' is over, but the last song featured on the show, ''Don't Stop Believin' '' which the band Journey released in 1981, keeps going as its lyrics say, ''on and on and on and on.''</p>
        <p>According to Legacy Recordings, a division of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, downloads of the song from iTunes went from about 1,000 on the day before the episode to 6,531 the day after. For the week, the song climbed to No. 17 in popularity on iTunes, while the band's ''Greatest Hits'' also cracked the Top 20.</p>

        <p>''The Sopranos'' is over, but the last song featured on the show, ''Don't Stop Believin' '' which the band Journey released in 1981, keeps going as its lyrics say, ''on and on and on and on.''</p>
        <p>According to Legacy Recordings, a division of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, downloads of the song from iTunes went from about 1,000 on the day before the episode to 6,531 the day after. For the week, the song climbed to No. 17 in popularity on iTunes, while the band's ''Greatest Hits'' also cracked the Top 20.</p>
        <p>On the radio, airplay of ''Don't Stop Believin' '' increased 192 percent Monday through Thursday over the first four days of the previous week, according to Nielsen BDS, which tracks airplay.</p>
        <p>It was not the first time the band had television to thank for a royalties windfall. In 2005, after ''Don't Stop Believin' '' was featured on the season premiere of MTV's ''Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,'' it ranked in the top 10 on iTunes.</p>
        <p>The song also enjoyed a 150 percent increase in downloads the week after it was featured in an episode of ''Family Guy'' on Fox in 2005, according to Nielsen.</p>
        <p>While song downloads were not tracked in 2003, when ''Don't Stop Believin' '' was featured in NBC's ''Scrubs,'' overall retail sales of Journey's ''Greatest Hits'' increased 51 percent in the first full week after the show aired, according to Nielsen.</p>
        <p>Sopranos fans, meanwhile, have been puzzling over why the show's creator, David Chase, chose it as the swan song. Does he really like it, or was he being cheeky?</p>
        <p>In 1999, Harper's Magazine published an article by Bill Wasik, ''What Would Journey Do?'' in which solutions for moral quandaries are found in the band's lyrics. For someone contemplating suicide, ''Don't Stop Believin' '' is evoked: ''In the face of such sorrow and hopelessness, does Journey go on to say that we should give up the fight? No! Instead we are told to not stop believing. To hold on to that feeling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wasik, now a senior editor at Harper's, wrote the piece as satire but describes himself as a ''passionate fan'' of Journey and takes umbrage at those who smirk at the band. ''The band is cheesy in the same way that love is cheesy,'' Mr. Wasik said.</p>
        <p>Last week Journey announced on its Web site that it had parted ways with singer Jeff Scott Soto, the second to stand in for Steve Perry, who fronted the band during its glory days but left acrimoniously in 1996. The remaining four members are ''taking the rest of 2007 off,'' according to journeymusic.com.</p>
