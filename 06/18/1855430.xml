        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Losing Count'' (Op-Ed, June 14):</p>
        <p>Thane Rosenbaum speaks for the silent majority of survivors and many of us children of survivors who have been deeply troubled by the way Holocaust settlement funds have been handled in recent years.</p>
        <p>These are precious resources that can make an enormous difference in the lives of elderly and ailing survivors. The institutions entrusted with the allocation of funds have gone badly off track.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenbaum's suggested prescriptions would give priority to the rights and needs of survivors and bring some openness and accountability where they are needed most.</p>
        <p>Daniel Kadden  Olympia, Wash., June 14, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a Holocaust survivor and one who works intimately with the Jewish Claims Conference as its treasurer, I know that the claims conference is not perfect and some mistakes have been made.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there was and is no other organization more actively involved in correcting the injustices committed by the Nazis and their collaborators against the Jews.</p>
        <p>The compensation the claims conference negotiated over the years with the German government, German industry and other entities resulted in substantial payments to Jewish Holocaust survivors. The efforts of the claims conference also resulted in large payments for non-Jewish slave and forced laborers.</p>
        <p>Such payments can never compensate us for the atrocities we suffered, but they are a potent symbolic acknowledgment of history's greatest crime.</p>
        <p>Today the claims conference helps tens of thousands of survivors in need who continue to be ignored by the community at large.</p>
        <p>I am proud of the claims conference's record, as flawed as it may be.</p>
        <p>Roman Kent  New York, June 14, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is chairman of American Gathering/Federation of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.</p>
