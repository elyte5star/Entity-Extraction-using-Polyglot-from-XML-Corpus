        <p>Recent scandals and the election of Gov. Eliot Spitzer have taken a toll on the party scene among state legislators.</p>

        <p>Martin Connor flicked his eyes down the bar, surveying all the unoccupied chairs. The room was too empty. The music was too loud. ''I never see legislators here anymore,'' he groused, lacing his fingers around a glass of pinot noir.</p>
        <p>It was a Wednesday night at Elda's on Lark, a bar and restaurant two blocks from the Capitol. Lawmakers would once have been strolling through the doors for a drink or three, or six. But Mr. Connor, a long-serving state senator from Brooklyn Heights, saw no familiar faces. ''I keep thinking, I'm 62 -- am I out of it? Maybe this isn't the place anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Nah,'' he decided. ''There's not an everybody place anymore.''</p>
        <p>About 15 years ago, Albany was full of everybody places -- bars and restaurants that were a second home to the lawmakers during the three or four days a week they spend in the capital during legislative sessions.</p>
        <p>But Albany's political night life, long in decline, suffered a new blow this year: the arrival of Gov. Eliot Spitzer. He declared it unseemly to hold fund-raisers in the capital. He has championed new laws under which lobbyists can no longer pick up the tab for a table full of lawmakers. And the governor's people, it is said, prefer to spend their nights at the office.</p>
        <p>''The bars may be suffering, but we hear the coffee shops are doing quite well,'' said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the governor.</p>
        <p>But Albany was never known for its coffee shops. Lawmakers once flocked to the bars and restaurants near the Capitol for dinner, or drinks, or tomfoolery. Occasionally, they would meet for all three, and some still do. In April, an assemblyman was charged with drunken driving and speeding after, according to the Albany police, he was caught driving 65 miles per hour in a 30 m.p.h. zone.</p>
        <p>But most tales of the old days never made the papers. The young woman who plucked the spectacles off a bookish assemblyman and said he could stay the night at her place if he could find his way there without them. The sumptuous dinners with a colleague from across the aisle or across the state. The booze. The late nights. The booze.</p>
        <p>Those habits began to die out in the 1990s, many lawmakers say, when politics became more partisan. The nonpartisan hangouts downtown, like the Plaza Grill a few blocks from the Capitol, were replaced by new spots where people gathered with their own political kind.</p>
        <p>But more significant, all agree, were the accusations of harassment and even assault made by staff members or interns, mostly younger and female, against older, more powerful men. They culminated in the 2004 conviction of a senior aide to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for sexual misconduct.</p>
        <p>Stringent new rules enjoining lawmakers from fraternizing with interns followed, and with them came a far less forgiving atmosphere. This spring, a married Assemblyman was censured by his colleagues after admitting that he fell asleep on the floor of an intern's apartment after a night at a sports bar. The intern was fired.</p>
        <p>Ethics rules were gradually tightened too, beginning with a 2006 decision by the state lobbying commission limiting gifts to lawmakers to less than $75 per year per giver.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that a lobbyist would call and say, 'I've got some people from the Senate or Assembly, and there are 15 of them, and I want seven bottles of wine on the table, food -- soup to nuts,' '' said Paul Mancino, the owner of Lombardo's, an Italian place a few blocks from the Executive Mansion. Politicians still tread the black-and-white tile floor there, but now they trickle in by twos and threes and they ask for separate checks.</p>
        <p>Shortly after taking office, Mr. Spitzer brokered a bill with the Legislature that banned all but ''nominal'' gifts, which many lawmakers have interpreted as a prohibition on all but the occasional ceremonial baseball cap. Though there are loopholes -- a lobbyist can still donate to a legislator's political action committee, for example, which in turn could foot the bill for dinner -- lobbyists, lawmakers and restaurateurs say the change has dampened Albany night life.</p>
        <p>Some grumble about bad apples ruining it for everybody else. Others say that Albany's old collegiality owed a lot to lobbyists' largesse. As one lawmaker, who wished to remain unknown, put it, ''It's funny how when you take away the free booze and take away the babes, people just aren't as interested in hanging out.''</p>
        <p>Indicative of the new climate, perhaps, is a group of dinner companions calling themselves the Morality Caucus. It is composed of Craig M. Johnson, David J. Valesky and José M. Serrano, all Democratic state senators in their 30s and 40s. By Mr. Johnson's account, their evenings rarely go past 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>''We eat dinner early,'' he said. ''And once we eat, we like to go back to our hotels, call our families and call it a night.'' Pause. ''Really.''</p>
        <p>There used to be so many fund-raisers every night, held by trade associations, elected officials or their parties, that you could stack them three and four deep on your schedule and still have to miss a few. Lobbyists and activists would make merry with lawmakers and drop off a check for a re-election campaign or a party committee.</p>
        <p>But even before taking office, Mr. Spitzer -- him again -- pledged to hold no campaign fund-raisers in Albany, on the grounds that people might get the wrong idea about how bills become law.</p>
        <p>And the big group dinners are gone, replaced by dinner cliques of lawmakers who are already friends.</p>
        <p>On a recent Monday, for example, Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens assemblyman, called to order the regular meeting of the Smokey Bones Caucus, of which he is the chairman. The caucus -- which includes Mark S. Weprin, Keith L. T. Wright, J. Gary Pretlow, Jeffrion L. Aubry and Andrew Hevesi, all Assembly Democrats from districts in or near New York City -- gathers at a barbecue restaurant of the same name just outside Albany. The agenda is limited, mostly, to ribs, the Mets and the restaurant's homemade doughnuts.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago we would have gone out with a lobbyist,'' said Mr. Wright, who has been in the Assembly for 15 years. ''My first year, I went to all those dinners.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aubry interjected: ''I went to as many as I could!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright continued. ''Then I got bored. You've having dinner, and then the lobbyist says, 'Let me tell you about proprietary colleges.' ''</p>
        <p>There were chortles all around. ''It used to be, you might go to a bar and have a drink,'' Mr. Weprin said. ''Now you might go to a bar and there are interns there.''</p>
        <p>''And then you get arrested!'' Mr. Pretlow said.</p>
        <p>''It's a different time, a different time,'' Mr. Wright said. ''You got to be chill.''</p>
