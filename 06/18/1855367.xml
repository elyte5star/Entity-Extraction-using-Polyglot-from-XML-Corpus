        <p>'Four' Proves Bigger Than 'Thirteen'</p>
        <p>''Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,'' the superhero saga starring Jessica Alba, far right, and Ioan Gruffudd, right, and distributed by Fox, piled up $57.4 million at North American box offices over the weekend to end the one-week reign of the casino caper ''Ocean's Thirteen'' as the top-grossing film. ''Ocean's Thirteen'' (Warner Brothers), which took in $37.1 million in its opening weekend, drew $19.1 million in its second weekend and fell to second place in the estimates compiled by the box-office tracking company Media by Numbers. The comedy ''Knocked Up'' (Universal) held on to third place with $14.5 million, while ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' (Buena Vista) grossed $12 million for a total of $273.7 million in its fourth week in theaters. Fifth place went to ''Surf's Up'' (Sony), with $9.3 million. Among the season's other blockbusters, ''Shrek the Third'' (Paramount), with $9 million, finished in sixth place and reached $297.2 million in its fifth week in theaters; and ''Spider-Man 3'' (Sony) took 10th place with $2.5 million, giving it a total of $330 million in its seventh week in theaters.</p>
        <p>China's Watchdogs Nip 'Pirates'</p>
        <p>''Pirates of the Caribbean'' has run afoul of China's censors, leaving half the role of the pirate lord Sao Feng, played by Chow Yun-Fat, below, on the cutting-room floor, Agence France-Presse reported. Chinese state news media said that censors slashed his role in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' to 10 minutes from 20. The official news agency Xinhua said the deletions were made because the role ''vilifies and humiliates the Chinese.'' Xinhua did not specify criticisms, but said that a film magazine's description of Sao Feng -- bald and scarred, with long nails and a beard -- was ''in line with Hollywood's old tradition of demonizing the Chinese.'' Although Zhang Pimin, a film official, said the cuts would not spoil the film, fans on sina.com, a popular Web site, disagreed, saying the plot was now difficult to follow. ''It is such a marvelous movie, but it has been changed beyond recognition,'' one person wrote. ''It really shocked me.''</p>
        <p>Another Encore By Johnny Cash</p>
        <p>The 16th album since Johnny Cash died in September 2003 is on its way. Titled ''The Great Lost Performance'' and recorded at a concert on July 27, 1990, at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park, N.J., the album, from Universal Music, is to be released next month, Reuters reported. With 18 songs and plenty of banter, it features duets with June Carter Cash (''Jackson'' and ''The Wreck of the Old '97'') and the Johnny Cash classics ''I Walk the Line'' and ''Folsom Prison Blues.''</p>
        <p>Elton John in Ukraine</p>
        <p>An audience of 200,000 turned out in Independence Square in Kiev on Saturday night to hear Elton John, above, in a concert to foster awareness of AIDS and H.I.V. in Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported. ''I am here to support you all against AIDS,'' he told the crowd, which included President Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's former leader Leonid Kuchma, the Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and top government officials. Mr. John's AIDS foundation has financed 23 AIDS and H.I.V.-related projects in Ukraine in the past six years. A freak storm that injured 20 people, toppled metal towers, huge speakers and lights and overturned cars on Friday night, wiped out the four-day Heineken Jammin' Festival that had started on Thursday and drew 20,000 music fans to Mestre, the mainland section of greater Venice, where Pearl Jam, Aerosmith and the Smashing Pumpkins were to perform, the BBC reported.</p>
        <p>'Atonement' in Venice</p>
        <p>The 64th Venice Film Festival will open with ''Atonement,'' directed by Joe Wright (''Pride &amp; Prejudice''), adapted by Christopher Hampton from the Booker Prize-winning Ian McEwan novel of the same title, and starring Keira Knightley, James McAvoy and Vanessa Redgrave, Reuters reported. The novel spans the years from the 1930s to the end of the 20th century in relating the consequences of a monstrous lie told by a 13-year-old girl that will send her older sister's lover to jail and shatter the staid, upper-middle-class existence of an English family. The Venice festival begins on Aug. 29 and runs through Sept. 8. ''The Unknown,'' a tale of white slavery directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (''Cinema Paradiso''), has won the David di Donatello prizes, Italy's Oscars, for best picture and best director, Variety.com reported. The star, Ksenia Rappoport, who plays a secretive East European prostitute who becomes a cleaning lady haunted by her pimp, was named best actress, and its score by Ennio Morricone also won a David. The accolade for best actor went to Elio Germano for his portrayal of a young neo-Fascist in Daniele Luchetti's political comedy ''My Brother Is an Only Child.''</p>
        <p>Author Apologizes For 'Midnight Express'</p>
        <p>Billy Hayes, below, has apologized to Turkey for the depiction of the country in ''Midnight Express,'' the 1978 Alan Parker film based on an Oscar-winning Oliver Stone screenplay about Mr. Hayes's ordeal in a Turkish prison where he was serving 30 years for attempting to smuggle hashish, Agence France-Presse reported. ''I did not write the screenplay or direct the film, but I should accept my share of responsibility for the damage it has done,'' he was quoted as telling reporters on Friday. He said that the image of Turkey and the Turkish people created by the film ''was not fair to them or true to my experience.'' Mr. Hayes, whose book about his ordeal, including his escape, was the basis for the screenplay, was back in Istanbul for an international security conference. Although he had been barred from returning, the police said the ban had been lifted temporarily because Mr. Hayes was ''sincere in his remorse.'' Mr. Stone, who visited Turkey in 2004, said he never intended ''to be against Turkey'' and that ''perhaps some of the zealousness'' of the film ''came from being young and trying to make the point too much.''</p>
        <p>Goldmans Win Rights To Simpson Book</p>
        <p>A federal bankruptcy judge has awarded the rights to the canceled O. J. Simpson book, ''If I Did It,'' to the family of Ron Goldman, who was slain with Mr. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson in 1994, The Associated Press reported. Judge A. Jay Cristol ruled that Lorraine Brooke Associates, which owned rights to the book and is run by Mr. Simpson's daughter Arnelle, was ''clearly accomplished to perpetuate a fraud.'' The Goldmans are seeking to make proceeds from the book part of a nearly $33.5 million civil jury award they have been trying to collect for nearly a decade from Mr. Simpson, who was found liable for the deaths. The judge said Mr. Simpson's book contract with HarperCollins, and a money trail showing $630,000 transferred from the publisher to Lorraine Brooke Associates and then to Mr. Simpson for his expenses, confirmed his connection to the company. Paul Battista, a lawyer for the Goldmans, said the decision ''ensures that Mr. Simpson will never see another dime from this book.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 4, 2007, Wednesday  A report by The Associated Press in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column on June 18, about a decision by a federal bankruptcy judge in a case involving a canceled book by O. J. Simpson, ''If I Did It,'' misidentified the party to whom the judge awarded the rights to the book. It was a court-appointed trustee -- not the family of Ronald Goldman, who was killed along with Mr. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, in 1994. Further developments are in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column today.</p>
