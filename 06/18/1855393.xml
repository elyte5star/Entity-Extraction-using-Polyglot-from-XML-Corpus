        <p>BANKING ON A NEW NAME -- Bank of America built its brand as a financial supermarket that could be all things to all people. But it is looking to the U.S. Trust name to help burnish its private bank's reputation in catering to the very rich. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>MARVEL, THE MOVIE MAKER -- Hollywood's major studios have paid to license Marvel characters to create blockbuster franchises -- including the three ''Spider-Man'' hits -- but the company is no longer content to leave the actual moviemaking (and most of the profits) to the studios. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NEW HOPES AT AIRBUS -- Since the Farnborough International Airshow last summer, Airbus has changed chief executives twice and warned that delays with its A380 superjumbo jet would wipe out billions in earnings over the next four years. Now it is hoping another aircraft, the twin-engine A350, will be its salvation. [C1.]</p>
        <p>The United States Air Force has decided to push development of a new type of fuel to power its bombers and fighters, mixing conventional jet fuel with fuels from nonpetroleum sources that could eventually limit military dependence on imported oil. [C10.]</p>
        <p>A TABLE FOR MILLIONS -- For decades, restaurants have relied on the telephone to take table reservations and on piles of index cards -- or a maitre d'hotel's memory -- to collect information about diners and their quirks. At last, it seems, the restaurant business has gone unabashedly high-tech. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PLEASE KEEP THE PHONE ON -- Typically you are told to turn off your cellphone before a performance. But at a recent Saturday matinee of ''Spring Awakening,'' the Broadway musical that garnered eight Tony Awards last week, the audience was told to do just the opposite. [C8.]</p>
        <p>BLOCKBUSTER PICKS BLU-RAY -- Blockbuster will rent high-definition DVDs only in the Blu-ray format in 1,450 stores when it expands its high-def offerings next month, dealing a major blow to the rival HD DVD format. [C2.]</p>
        <p>A BETTER EBAY -- Under pressure from analysts and investors to jump-start growth in the company's core auctions business, Meg Whitman, left, chief executive of eBay, is making a series of upgrades intended to make the site more friendly to buyers. E-Commerce Report: Bob Tedeschi. [C5.]</p>
        <p>CONDOM ADS REJECTED -- A commercial for Trojan condoms that features anthropomorphized, cellphone-toting pigs has been rejected by Fox and CBS. Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>FREENET DEVELOPER WEIGHS IN -- In 2000, Ian Clarke started a global controversy by deploying an online system called Freenet to let people share information anonymously. With a new venture called Thoof, he has not given up on his original goal: to engender democracy by making it simple to share accurate information. [C11.]</p>
        <p>GORE TO ADDRESS ADVERTISERS -- The brightest lights in the advertising business are gathering in Cannes, France, this week for an annual celebration of the art of persuading consumers to part with their money. On Friday, Al Gore will come to town. [C8.]</p>
        <p>CASH INFUSION FOR DRUG MAKER -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, a developer of treatments for diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, is expected to announce today that it has signed deals with two private equity firms that will invest nearly $300 million into the publicly held company. [C2.]</p>
        <p>BUYOUT TALKS ARE SAID TO FALTER -- Buyout talks between Cadence Design Systems, one of the largest makers of the software used to design computer chips, and two private equity firms appear to have stalled over price. [C2.]</p>
        <p>CADBURY EXPECTED TO SELL UNIT -- Cadbury Schweppes is preparing to announce that it will sell its American beverage business, which includes 7-Up, Dr Pepper and Snapple, according to people close to the company. [C2.]</p>
