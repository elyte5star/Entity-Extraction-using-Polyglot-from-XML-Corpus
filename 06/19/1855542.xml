        <p>Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest specialty chemical maker, said Monday that it had rejected a takeover bid from Akzo Nobel worth £7.2 billion ($14 billion), terming the offer too low.</p>
        <p>Akzo, the world's largest maker of paints and coatings, earlier this month offered to pay £6 for each Imperial  share. The shares jumped as high as  £6.44, a gain of 17 percent and their highest level in eight years, in London trading Monday, valuing Imperial  at more than £7.6 billion as investors expected Akzo to increase its bid. Akzo said Monday that it would continue to evaluate all strategic opportunities, including  its offer for Imperial.</p>
        <p>Akzo has enough cash for a larger acquisition after its sale of its drugs unit Organon in March to Schering-Plough, the American drug maker, for $14.4 billion. After the sale, some analysts said Akzo was under pressure to make an acquisition or risk becoming a takeover target itself.</p>
        <p>Andrew Benson, an analyst at Citigroup in London, said Akzo and Imperial were both ''well placed to participate in consolidation'' in the global paints market and that each could buy the other, but that Akzo was more likely to be the suitor because it was financially stronger. A combination could result in cost savings of £120 million, he said.</p>
        <p>BASF, the German chemicals company, or Dow Chemical, a United States rival, may also be interested in Imperial, though Akzo would be able to pay more, analysts have said.</p>
        <p>Consolidation in the coats and paintings industry is expected to intensify as companies  look for growth in a market that is among the most fragmented, with the top 10 companies together having a 50 percent share. Akzo has the biggest market share, with 10 percent, followed by Sherwin-Williams. Steady cash flows also make the industry attractive to private equity buyers, driving up valuations.</p>
        <p>Buying Imperial would give Akzo businesses in Asia and the United States  and help it profit from growing demand for coatings in regions like Eastern Europe and Asia. Shares of Imperial had already gained 21.5 percent this year, in part because investors viewed the company as a takeover target after some earlier asset sales  reduced debt.</p>
        <p>John McAdam, Imperial's chief executive, had focused on household paints, coatings and varnishes; cut jobs; and started to reduce a pension deficit. And last year, the company  sold its fragrances division  and its beauty products business.</p>
