        <p>A 23-year-old bass-baritone from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music has won the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition, the BBC reported. Triumphing over four finalists remaining from the 25 singers chosen to audition, the winner, Shen Yang, was the youngest competitor in the weeklong contest, which once helped to start the international career of the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel. Mr. Shen received a trophy from Joan Sutherland, the patron of the competition, and $30,000 in prize money and engagements with the BBC and the Welsh National Opera. Afterward Mr. Shen said, ''I think the competition is not only a competition; it's a big singing party in the world.''</p>
