        <p>North Korea could be ready to begin shutting down its plutonium-producing reactor within weeks as the first step toward disabling it by the end of this year, the top United States negotiator on North Korea's nuclear weapons program said here on Monday.</p>
        <p>The negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, said  stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after a visit by nuclear inspectors. North Korea has invited inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring program, to visit for talks about verifying and monitoring a shutdown.</p>
        <p>''This is an event we have been looking forward to for some time,'' Mr. Hill said after talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei.</p>
        <p>The atomic energy agency said it would send a team to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, next week to discuss how its inspectors would verify the shutdown, The Associated Press reported from Vienna.</p>
        <p>North Korea had refused to proceed with a February agreement to begin decommissioning its reactor in Yongbyon until $25 million in accounts linked to North Korea held in a Macao bank was transferred to North Korea.</p>
        <p>The money was frozen when the United States accused the bank, Banco Delta Asia, of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea.</p>
        <p>After months of wrangling over the method of returning the money, it  was  wired Thursday to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. It was  then to be sent to Russia's central bank before a further transfer to an account controlled by North Korea in a Russian commercial bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill said he would hold further talks this week with disarmament negotiators from Russia, South Korea and Japan on steps to make up for some of the time lost while the transfer was being organized. These discussions would also involve setting a timetable for resumption of six-nation arms control talks.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement reached at a session of those talks in February, North Korea pledged to shut the Yongbyon reactor and to allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50,000-ton shipment of fuel oil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill said  the atomic energy agency's inspectors would hold talks with North Korea on verifying the Yongbyon shutdown and sealing the reactor, which would include the installation of television monitors at the site and other technical matters.</p>
        <p>''Our sense is we will be down to a matter of weeks,'' he said. ''We are not talking about months.''</p>
        <p>In the next phase, North Korea would disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950,000 tons of fuel oil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill said that from a ''technical point of view'' it would be possible to conclude that part of the agreement by the end of the year.</p>
