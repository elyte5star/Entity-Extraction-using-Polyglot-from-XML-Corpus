        <p>The Emerson String Quartet ended its long and busy residency at Carnegie Hall on Sunday night fittingly, with Beethoven's farewell to the medium but also with a new piece by Kaija Saariaho. In the last three weeks the Emerson has coached and presented young ensembles and itself gone through the Beethoven repertory onstage, adding other composers to its programs here and there.</p>
        <p>I can't resist repeating that a 2,800-seat space is not the right place to hear four string players play chamber music, but you can't argue with the economics. Carnegie's Stern Auditorium was not as full as it seemed to be on my last trip to this series two weeks ago, but there were certainly two or three times more ticket buyers than the building's two smaller (and more appropriate) Weill and Zankel Halls could have held.</p>

        <p>I can't resist repeating that a 2,800-seat space is not the right place to hear four string players play chamber music, but you can't argue with the economics. Carnegie's Stern Auditorium was not as full as it seemed to be on my last trip to this series two weeks ago, but there were certainly two or three times more ticket buyers than the building's two smaller (and more appropriate) Weill and Zankel Halls could have held.</p>
        <p>For his last quartet (Op. 135) Beethoven revisits his ''happy'' key of F. Just as with the Sixth and Eighth Symphonies, there is the joy-in-living theme together with a don't-waste-my-time methodology. We experience sunlight, in other words, but with it an abruptness that is happy to jump suddenly into the listener's consciousness and do away with elaborate throat clearings and polite introductions.</p>
        <p>As in most of Beethoven's last pieces, exquisite melodiousness, colored by his fascination with antique scales, alternates with a roughness approaching brutality. We shall never figure out whether a deaf musician had simply lost contact with the sound of live performances and the technical difficulties attached, or whether the man who had earlier created such luxurious color schemes as the ''Pastoral'' Symphony just wanted his audience to squirm.</p>
        <p>Like the late C sharp minor Quartet that came after intermission, Beethoven's sweeping sense of organization is exchanged for chains of events. The Emerson played the lyrical elements with great beauty, although the Presto of the C sharp minor was rushed and roughed up to the point of unintelligibility.</p>
        <p>No rough sounds for Ms. Saariaho's ''Terra Memoria,'' commissioned by Carnegie Hall and having its first performance here. Ms. Saariaho's elegant music begins and ends in whispery near-silence. Her care for the sound properties of instruments is a double gift to listeners. The overlapping conversations between voices are received as counterpoint, and yet the assembled sounds  create a single cloudlike sonority. Most of the piece sings in a pervasive tenor-to-treble range reminiscent of Ravel or Fauré. The more Ms. Saariaho engages the past, the more original her music becomes.</p>
