        <p>A Selden man has been charged with causing a fire last week that destroyed three cars and damaged a fourth at an auto repair shop on Sunrise Highway, the Suffolk County police said yesterday. The police said the man, Randy Galluzi, 38, was attempting to steal gasoline by using a cordless power drill to cut a hole in the bottom of a vehicle's gas tank at Sonrise Automotive about 9:20 p.m. last Wednesday. The gas ignited, and although Mr. Galluzi was able to escape without injury, the draining gas spread the fire to other vehicles, the police said. Mr. Galluzi was charged with criminal mischief and petit larceny, the police said. He pleaded not guilty yesterday at his arraignment in First District Court, according to the Suffolk County district attorney's office.</p>
