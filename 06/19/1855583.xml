        <p>The board of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority elected a veteran state assemblyman yesterday as its president and chief executive. The legislator, Paul D. Tonko, 58, left, of Amsterdam, was first elected to the Assembly in 1983 and has served as the chairman of its Energy Committee since 1992. The authority, with an annual budget of $409 million, finances energy research projects and energy efficiency programs through a surcharge on utility bills. It will be up to Gov. Eliot Spitzer to call a special election to fill the remainder of Mr. Tonko's two-year Assembly term; he was re-elected easily last November.</p>
