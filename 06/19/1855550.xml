        <p>Senator Barack Obama said his campaign ''made a mistake'' last week when it distributed a document  criticizing the support Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has received from Indian-Americans and companies that do business in India. ''The memo's caustic tone and its focus on contributions by Indian-Americans to the Clinton campaign was potentially hurtful, and as such, unacceptable,'' Mr. Obama said in a letter to Indian-Americans. The document, which referred to Mrs. Clinton as D-Punjab, caused a furor among Indian-American groups. Mr. Obama said he did not know about the memo, but added, ''I consider the entire campaign, and in particular myself, responsible for the mistake.''</p>
