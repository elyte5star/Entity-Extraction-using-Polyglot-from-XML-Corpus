        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re '' 'Been There?' Sometimes That Isn't The Point'' (June 12): As a World War II prisoner of war, I find Sally Satel's conclusions about Vietnam veterans asking ''Been There?'' facile.</p>
        <p>A psychiatric resident doesn't have the gravitas of an experienced therapist. Many combat veterans lead lives of controlled rage. They rage at their condition; they rage at being misunderstood; and sometimes they even rage at God for allowing them to fall into this snake pit. To gain their confidence you must first earn their trust.</p>
        <p>Physical wounds heal; psychic wounds are forever. These are the wounds that plague our days, haunt our nights. I agree that a clinician's most valuable asset is experience, and I'm grateful my counselor is not a first-year resident.</p>
