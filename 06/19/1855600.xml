        <p>A man who served as his own defense lawyer was sentenced yesterday to 32 years to life in prison for killing a companion. At his sentencing in State Supreme Court, the man, Gregory Zalevsky, 52, submitted a handwritten 29-page motion to vacate his conviction for the murder of Irina Ilyina, 31, a mother of two from New Jersey. Ms. Ilyina, who had been dating Mr. Zalevsky while seeking a divorce from her husband, was found smothered in Mr. Zalevsky's Brighton Beach apartment in July 2004. In the courtroom, Justice Matthew J. D'Emic denied Mr. Zalevsky's motion. Ms. Ilyina's parents, sister and former husband asked for a long prison sentence, calling Mr. Zalevsky a ''monster.'' In a statement to the court, Mr. Zalevsky said he expected to be exonerated.</p>
