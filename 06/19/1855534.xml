        <p>The private equity firm Blackstone Group said yesterday that it had agreed to buy an Indian back-office company, Intelenet Global Services Ltd., for an undisclosed sum, in its first management buyout in India.</p>
        <p>Blackstone will own 80 percent of Intelenet, with the company's management holding the rest.</p>
        <p>The Economic Times, quoting unidentified sources, said the deal could be worth $200 million.</p>
        <p>This would value the company at more than double its back-office rival, Allsec Technologies Ltd., which has a market capitalization of $77 million and is 28 percent owned by the Carlyle Group.</p>
        <p>The British bank Barclays and an Indian mortgage firm, the Housing Development Finance Corporation, said separately that they each were selling their  holdings in Intelenet, without disclosing the price.</p>
        <p>Intelenet plans to expand its operations in Britain and begin services out of the Philippines and Mauritius, said its chief executive, Susir Kumar.</p>
