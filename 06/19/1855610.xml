        <p>After the first cracks in the subprime mortgage business appeared late last year, several large lenders were forced into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Now, the stress is sending tremors down Wall Street, as investment funds that bought a stake in those loans are starting to wobble.</p>
        <p>Industry officials say they expect this second act to be longer and slower, unwinding over the next 12 to 18 months.  The fallout could further constrict consumers with weak, or subprime, credit while helping to prolong the housing downturn.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the impact could be far more significant: It could force banks, hedge funds and pension funds to acknowledge substantial losses, which had been tucked away in complex investment vehicles that are hard to evaluate. In turn, that could limit the money available for mortgage lending.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, two hedge funds operated by a division of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that is a dominant player in mortgage bonds, fought for their survival as three lenders --  Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase --  asked Bear Stearns to put up more capital.</p>
        <p>The funds appeared to have won a reprieve after executives at Bear Stearns Asset Management told creditors that they had lined up $500 million in new capital from a consortium led by Citigroup and Barclays, the British bank,  according to a  person who had been briefed but was not authorized to speak publicly. Last week, the fund sold about $3.6 billion in high-grade securities backed by subprime mortgages.</p>
        <p>It remained unclear whether the new financing, with the details expected to be worked out today, will be enough to put off plans by Merrill Lynch to seize and auction $400 million of the Bear funds' assets.</p>
        <p>''Basically, Bear is trying to prevent the great unwind of their fund,'' said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm that helps investors gauge risk. ''The reason people are watching this carefully is because they're wondering whether this is going to lead to others doing the same, or will this be contained.''</p>
        <p>Bad bets on risky subprime securities and the direction of an index that tracks subprime bonds caused the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage fund of Bear Stearns to tumble 23 percent in the year through the end of April. A related fund has fallen less.</p>
        <p>The leveraged fund, which had raised $600 million in investments when it was started 10 months ago, leveraged itself, or borrowed, about $6 billion from numerous Wall Street banks and brokerage houses. When losses began mounting this spring, some investors stepped forward to redeem their money. In May, the fund stopped allowing redemptions.</p>
        <p>So far, the distress has been muted, which has surprised some investors and analysts who believed that rising defaults by homeowners would have left investors with sizable losses by now.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Tavakoli and other industry specialists noted that the housing market moves slowly, much more so than, say, the stock market. Also, subprime mortgages are packaged in securities that are structured to withstand relatively high rates of default before most investors lose any money.</p>
        <p>''Mortgage finance occurs in slow motion compared to other parts of the financial markets,'' said Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer at the TCW Group, an investment management company that manages $85 billion in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. ''This isn't an Enron corporate bond that goes into default overnight. This is a process that takes 30, 60, and 90 days of delinquencies before it goes into foreclosure.''</p>
        <p>The riskiest portions of mortgage bonds -- which also hold the promise of higher returns -- are held by a small group of investors. The biggest holders of that risk are investment funds known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. The holdings of these funds, which are once or twice removed from the underlying loans, are often hard to value because it is often unclear what portion of a bond they may own.</p>
        <p>Until the end of last year, many large institutional investors were willing to bet on subprime bonds and C.D.O.'s without even trying to value the underlying assets, said Louis Pizante, chief executive of Mavent, a firm that helps investors analyze thousands of mortgages at a time. Many simply placed investments in assets based on their credit ratings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pizante recalled what one customer said last year as he asked for only a basic assessment of mortgage loans: ''The broader your review is, the more reasons you are going to tell me why I can't buy these loans.''</p>
        <p>Now, he said, ''that attitude has definitely shifted,'' and investors are asking for more comprehensive reviews.</p>
        <p>Now, ratings agencies are increasingly downgrading bonds or signaling that they are watching for more downgrades. The activity is driven in large part by delinquency rates among borrowers, the value of their homes and the degree to which the structure of the bonds will protect investors, said Nicholas Weill, chief credit officer of the asset finance team at Moody's Investors Service.</p>
        <p>Moody's says that on average most investors in bonds backed by mortgages will be protected if losses do not exceed about 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The picture is different for C.D.O.'s, which have strategically invested in the riskiest portion of the mortgage bonds. They have also done so with a lot of borrowed money.</p>
        <p>''We don't really know the ripple effects,'' said one industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity and gravity of the situation. ''It is causing a revaluation of the securities, some of which may lead to additional liquidations. That's possible, but it's not set in stone.''</p>
