        <p>A teenager who fatally shot one boy and killed another at a summer block party was sentenced yesterday to 24 years in prison. The defendant, Vijai Dube, now 18, shot Harrichad Singh, 15, in the head and wrist in August 2005, and seriously wounded Shastra Sagar, 14, with a shot to the chest, the Queens district attorney's office said in a statement. The teenagers were at a block party in South Ozone Park when Mr. Dube, a 10th grader at the time, fired a semiautomatic handgun. The police caught up with him two days later. He pleaded guilty last month to first-degree manslaughter. In a statement read at his arraignment he said that the two boys kept looking at him and talking, which made him think they were planning something, so he went home to get the gun and returned to the party. The boy he killed was a high school student trying to graduate early.</p>
