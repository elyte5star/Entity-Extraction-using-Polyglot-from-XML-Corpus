        <p>Some people are born with silver spoons in their mouths. I grew up in a lead cocoon.</p>
        <p>My father, Dr. William S. Altman, known as Sol, was a radiologist, and his office and its X-ray machines occupied the first floor of our house in Quincy, Mass. To protect his staff members, his patients and our family from scatter radiation, he lined many walls, floors and doors with lead sheets. We learned to open and close those heavy doors carefully to avoid jamming a finger.</p>
        <p>Whether for convenience or frugality, many doctors, even in a technically oriented field like radiology, practiced in a home office until shortly after World War II.</p>
        <p>As I turn 70 today, I am reminded of this piece of Americana that has largely disappeared. Into the 1970s, X-rays helped detect many diseases, but changed the course of few.</p>
        <p>Radiology has made major advances since Wilhelm K. Roentgen discovered X-rays in 1895 in Germany, providing the first opportunity to see inside a body without opening it up.</p>
        <p>CT scans take radiographic slices of the body in details Roentgen could not have imagined. Interventional radiologists perform surgery guided by X-ray images to stop bleeding from the intestines, prevent some strokes and treat other problems. Use of radium furthered development of other radioactive isotopes that produce images to detect thyroid and other glandular abnormalities.</p>
        <p>These and other imaging techniques not based on radiation, like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, now spare many patients exploratory operations and improve the precision of surgery.</p>
        <p>My father was a man of enormous patience and a wonderful sense of humor who liked dealing with people. All of that contributed to an excellent bedside manner. In the early 1930s, after a year in general medicine, he became one of the first trained radiologists in this country. He changed fields in part because of a love of tinkering that he learned from his own father, who was an electrician.</p>
        <p>Fully respecting the hazards of radiation, he always wore cumbersome but protective lead aprons and gloves while working, unlike some colleagues, who later succumbed to leukemia and other blood ailments. He lived to 83; those who died younger included general practitioners who took X-rays in their offices.</p>
        <p>My father, like many radiologists, split the day between home and hospital offices.</p>
        <p>Occasionally he wrote scientific articles and reviews. Twice a week he volunteered to teach at Tufts University, where he and I attended medical school, and to join  colleagues who shared X-rays of their most perplexing or interesting cases.</p>
        <p>Routine use of X-rays caught on slowly in this country. In important ways, American radiology was a specialty imported from Germany. In bringing their expertise and equipment, German and Austrian refugee radiologists made Boston an early national leader in the field.</p>
        <p>The name of one, Dr. Richard Schatzki, is now attached to a circular narrowing of the esophagus  -- a Schatzki ring -- that causes  food to stick in the gullet of many patients.</p>
        <p>In time, American leaders emerged, and they joined the conferences when visiting Boston. One, Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, cured a case of Hodgkin's disease with radiation at Stanford, and I studied with him there as a visiting medical student.</p>
        <p>Radiologists were said to work regular hours,  but that was a myth. Often a middle-of-the-night call from the hospital would summon my father to look at the X-rays of accident victims and patients needing emergency surgery.  He considered the trips a normal part of his job.</p>
        <p>While emergency X-rays were performed at the local hospital, office practices handled elective cases. Some patients rang the office bell because they wanted an X-ray and expected it on demand, even in the middle of the night. My father explained calmly that radiologists never accepted a patient without a doctor's referral.</p>
        <p>The office telephone also rang in our living quarters because doctors and patients called at all hours to make appointments. My mother (Esther), my sister (Dorothy) or I would record an agreed-upon time in the appointment book and pass on to the patient instructions like not eating or drinking from midnight before the day of the requested procedure.</p>
        <p>Radiologists sometimes made house calls, usually for patients bedridden with a fractured hip. Dad's ''black bag'' was a portable X-ray machine the size of a large suitcase and heavy. Use of portable X-rays was limited, because the radiation exposure time was long and the quality of the films seldom matched those taken in an office.</p>
        <p>The first-floor waiting room was paneled in knotty pine. Magazines were piled on stands next to the chairs. To preserve the quiet atmosphere, my father would not let me take up the trumpet or drums. (He encouraged me to take piano and clarinet lessons, but the sour notes I produced upstairs could not have sounded any better.)</p>
        <p>Two rooms were for diagnostic X-rays, mostly of bones, lungs, kidneys and bowels. Mammograms were rarely performed in those days. Fluoroscopy -- the use of X-rays and a fluorescent screen to produce images of the body's internal structures, such as the stomach and intestines  --  was a standard procedure, performed in the dark. To see better, fluoroscopists wore red goggles; because it took time to adapt vision from light to dark, they would often wear them for about a half-hour beforehand. When my father went from the home office to the hospital to do fluoroscopies, my mother often drove him.</p>
        <p>Dad also performed special procedures. The one he hated most was a pneumoencephalogram,  in which he had to insert a needle in a patient's lower back, remove spinal fluid and inject air. That procedure could outline the ventricles in the brain on X-rays. But the patient invariably suffered an excruciating headache, and only the rare patient would agree to any additional test. Now the accuracy of CT and M.R.I. scans have made pneumoencephalograms a relic of the past, as they have a number of other once-routine procedures.</p>
        <p>A third room was for a different form of X-ray -- radiation therapy. Sometimes it was curative. But mostly it provided symptomatic relief and palliation, particularly in cancer, making radiologists known as ''the cancer doctors.''</p>
        <p>Before the introduction of steroid drugs, a small blast or two of radiation often was given for a few benign conditions. One was bursitis in the shoulder; radiation quickly relieved the pain and, with exercises, allowed restoration of full shoulder motion. Now radiation is rarely given for noncancerous ailments.</p>
        <p>Dad also used radium to treat cancers, mostly those of the cervix and uterus. He stored the radium in a lead-lined  case in a safe in the cellar.</p>
        <p>Today, we would call such treatments palliative, though they were not regarded that way in an era when most cancers were detected in their late stages. In my youth, chemotherapy was in its infancy, and people spoke about cancer in euphemisms. In something rarely seen today, many patients arrived with cancers that were so advanced they formed festering ulcers. Maggots even grew in a few such cancers.</p>
        <p>X-ray films were developed in a darkened room with the type of chemical solutions used for camera film. A technician mixed fresh solutions daily, and they stank. Radiologists would give a preliminary ''wet reading'' after looking at the X-rays before they dried. The digital age has eliminated those steps by making X-ray film obsolete.</p>
        <p>One convenience of a home office was that my father could go upstairs to nap. The bathroom doubled as a library, with stacks of the latest scientific journals.</p>
        <p>After dinner with the family, Dad went down to the office, stood before a viewing box, examined each patient's dry X-ray films, and dictated reports far into the night.</p>
        <p>I do not remember how old I was when I first joined him and peered over a shoulder at the films. But I have vivid memories of a number of patients who had large areas in their lung X-rays that appeared white, instead of the normal black, from silicosis --  a serious disease that many workers acquired in the local granite quarries. In such cases, my father taught me to take a closer look because silicosis increased the risk of tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>To the untrained eye, X-rays were mostly uninterpretable shadows. Radiologists learn to look at them in a disciplined, systematic way.  For example, they scan the chest X-rays that were taken at various angles. Then they look at the lungs, heart and ribs in detail.</p>
        <p>''The more experienced eye can take in a complex pattern of shadows and images almost at a glance and become instinctively sensitive to an abnormal contour or shadow,'' said Dr. Joseph T. Ferrucci Jr., the emeritus chairman of radiology at Boston University, whose radiologist father was one of my dad's colleagues.</p>
        <p>Radiologists and other medical specialists have a different perspective on patients and their diseases. As one aphorism puts it: A physician sees a patient at the bedside and imagines the disease. A radiologist sees the disease on the film and imagines the patient.</p>
        <p>As X-ray technology improved, my father often replaced older machines with newer, larger and more powerful ones that produced better pictures. Ultimately he had to expand the office to the point where only a rock garden was left between the front of the house and the street.</p>
        <p>The equipment often broke down. When the X-ray repairmen came, he joined them in spreading across the floor the diagrams needed to trace the complex circuitry and pinpoint the problem. His acumen was so sharp that Harvey Picker, whose company made X-ray machines, came along. I did not inherit those interests.</p>
        <p>My father was curious about the causes of the medical problems he saw and sought ways to prevent them. He drew out epidemiologic information by talking with patients. For example, he asked victims of automobile accidents about the model and color of the cars involved. Because so many victims said the color was dark, he bought only light-colored cars  (much easier to see at night)  and advised others to do likewise.</p>
        <p>Other conversations and observations convinced him, long before the 1964 surgeon general's report, that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer. No one in our household smoked, though relatives who did died from ailments related to smoking.</p>
        <p>My father was puzzled by why so many workers at the Fore River shipyard in Quincy developed mesotheliomas and other cancers. He tried to persuade the owners to find out why. Doctors later determined that many were from asbestos. Those anecdotes and studies kindled my interest in epidemiology.</p>
        <p>Dad and other radiologists would be irked when referring doctors failed to communicate the specific symptoms and physical findings that led them to order a patient's X-rays. Such details help radiologists know what to look for.</p>
        <p>The lack of precise information is still is a common problem between radiologists and referring doctors. And that is a symptom of a much larger problem: lapses in communication among medical professionals and the  public. It was partly to remedy such lapses, and partly to inform the public about medicine and its advances, that I chose the specialty I have pursued for four decades: medical journalism.</p>
