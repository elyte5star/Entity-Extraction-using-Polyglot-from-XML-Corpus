        <p>With a few strokes of his pen, Conrad M. Black ''systematically stole'' $60 million from the company he ran and controlled, a federal prosecutor said Monday in her closing argument against the former press tycoon and three associates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black, the former chairman and chief executive of the newspaper company Hollinger International, has been on trial here for three months on charges relating to accusations including obstruction of justice and tax fraud. Mr. Black, like his co-defendants, John A. Boultbee, Peter Y. Atkinson and Mark S. Kipnis, has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>In a daylong closing argument, Julie Ruder, an assistant United States attorney, frequently struck a tone of outrage and repeatedly dismissed the arguments of Mr. Black's defense team as ''ridiculous.'' She told the jury that had it had to  see past the defense's ''cover story'' that questionable payments were missed by auditors, were the result of bad advice by outside lawyers or were properly disclosed to company directors or shareholders.</p>
        <p>''Why did the shareholders receive $60 million less than they were supposed to?'' she asked. ''Ladies and gentleman, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on the crime.''</p>
        <p>Believing that the government's case in proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was weak, lawyers for Mr. Black and his co-defendants presented relatively brief defenses in which neither Mr. Black nor the others testified. Mr. Black's closing arguments are expected Tuesday.</p>
        <p>At its peak in the mid-1990s, Hollinger International was the world's third-largest newspaper company by circulation and owned The Daily Telegraph, The Jerusalem Post, The Chicago Sun-Times and many other newspapers. Mr. Black, who was ousted in 2004 amid charges of financial impropriety, has argued that he is the victim of a corporate-governance witch hunt.</p>
        <p>As part of her remarks, Ms. Ruder quoted one of the few defense witnesses, an accountant, Alan Funk, who had appeared on behalf of Mr. Kipnis and said that he had seen no evidence of fraud. On cross-examination, Ms. Ruder reminded the jury that Mr. Funk had said that ''sometimes the best fraudsters are better than the auditors. Concealing a fraud is part of the fraud.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ruder's basic storyline was that Mr. Black and his colleagues helped themselves to unauthorized bonuses and other perquisites. ''It's the company's money but he doesn't care,'' Ms. Ruder said. ''He's signing it away with the stroke of his pen.''</p>
        <p>The bulk of the $60 million came from so-called noncompete agreements that went to the four executives and to Mr. Black's longtime second in command, F. David Radler, as a result of the company selling most of its newspapers in Canada and the United States from 1998 to 2002.</p>
        <p>She cited several examples where she said the buyers did not specify that Mr. Black and the others should be paid personally or were not worried about Hollinger International, which is now called the Sun-Times Media Group, coming back and competing with them. Mr. Black's closing argument is expected to emphasize that noncompete payments are standard in the industry and the payments were authorized and disclosed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ruder told the jury that they would be told to view Mr. Radler's testimony with caution, given that he had pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud and testified against his former partner in exchange for potential lenience.</p>
        <p>On the witness stand, Mr. Radler repeatedly admitted to lying. But he also said the noncompete payment scheme originated with Mr. Black in a telephone call. Ms. Ruder asked the jury if they could believe that Mr. Black did not know what was going on when he received more money than anyone from the schemes.</p>
        <p>She also ridiculed some of the defense arguments against some of what prosecutors called abuses of perks by Mr. Black, including a trip on the company plane to Bora Bora for a holiday and the purchase of a Park Avenue apartment from the company.</p>
        <p>In the instance of the Bora Bora trip in 2001, which the prosecution contends cost around $500,000, Ms. Ruder noted that one of the arguments Mr. Black's lawyers have made is that there was no formal policy in place at the company about personal use of the plane.</p>
        <p>''That's just silly, ladies and gentlemen,'' Ms. Ruder said, comparing that argument to a Chicago Transit Authority bus driver who takes the bus he has been driving home to take his family to Wisconsin for the weekend.</p>
        <p>For the apartment, Ms. Ruder mocked Mr. Black's defense that it  was purchased at ''fair market value'' given that he had spent his own money to renovate and furnish the apartment during the six years the company owned it. A real estate appraiser who testified for the prosecution had said that the apartment, for which Mr. Black paid $3 million, was worth between $5.2 million and $8.5 million in 2000 when it was sold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black ''was able to buy the only apartment in New York City that had not appreciated a cent in six years of a massive real estate boom,'' Ms. Ruder said.</p>
