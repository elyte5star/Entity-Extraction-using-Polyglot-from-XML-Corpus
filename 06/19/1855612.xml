        <p>Rules limiting the number of hours hospital interns and residents can work were intended to improve patient care, but there were fears that signing cases over to a new team at a specified time would be harmful.

        <p>Over two years, researchers at Yale-New Haven Hospital gathered data on length of stay, 30-day readmission rates and medication errors before and after the new rules were instituted -- both on teaching services, where the new work-hour rules apply, and, as a control, on nonteaching services where the rules did not change.</p>

        <p>Rules limiting the number of hours hospital interns and residents can work were intended to improve patient care, but there were fears that signing cases over to a new team at a specified time would be harmful. Those fears have not been realized, according to a new study, and the work-hour rules have resulted in better care for patients.</p>
        <p>Over two years, researchers at Yale-New Haven Hospital gathered data on length of stay, 30-day readmission rates and medication errors before and after the new rules were instituted -- both on teaching services, where the new work-hour rules apply, and, as a control, on nonteaching services where the rules did not change.</p>
        <p>The teaching services saw a decrease in transfers to the intensive care unit, a decrease in medication errors and an increase in discharges to home or rehabilitation. After adjusting for other variables, there was also a significant decrease in deaths. While drug interaction errors increased, they also increased on the nonteaching service, probably because of the addition of new interaction rules to the database.</p>
        <p>The authors acknowledge that their study, published in the July 17 issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine, was not randomized, that it was limited to one hospital and that they depended on administrative data that might have contained inaccuracies or inconsistencies.</p>
