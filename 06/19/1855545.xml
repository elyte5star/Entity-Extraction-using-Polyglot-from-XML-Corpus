        <p>Bryan Petersen ended the longest game in College World Series history with a run-scoring single in the bottom of the 13th inning, giving California-Irvine a 5-4 victory Monday against Cal State Fullerton in an elimination game.</p>
        <p>The 5-hour-40-minute game beat the old Series mark by 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>Petersen's winning hit came after Fullerton left fielder Josh Fellhauer threw out Taylor Holiday at home plate.</p>
        <p>California-Irvine (46-16-1), making its first Series appearance, advances to a game Tuesday against the loser of Monday night's game between Arizona State and Oregon State. Fullerton (38-25) went two games and out at the series for the first time in nine appearances since 1990.</p>
        <p>Despite making six errors, California-Irvine came back three times to tie the score before taking the lead in a tense 13th, in which Fullerton Coach George Horton was ejected for arguing a hit-batsman call. There were eight hit batters in the game.</p>
        <p>The previous longest game was in 1981, when Oklahoma State needed five hours to defeat Arizona State, 11-10, in 13 innings.</p>
        <p>Oregon State defeated fifth-ranked Arizona State, 12-6, in the delayed second game.</p>
        <p>Beavers left fielder Mike Lissman drove in four runs, including a three-run homer in the second inning. Second baseman Joey Wong also drove in three runs.</p>
        <p>Pitcher Michael Stutes allowed four runs, three hits and five walks in six and a third innings.</p>
