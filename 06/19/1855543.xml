        <p>A family court judge in Vermont on Friday dissolved a civil union between two women whose fight over their daughter had attracted national attention and for a time put a judge in Virginia at odds with one in Vermont over whether a child can have two mothers.</p>
        <p>The Vermont judge, William D. Cohen of Rutland Family Court, affirmed that the two women were legal parents of Isabella Miller-Jenkins, 5. But Judge Cohen awarded sole physical and legal custody of Isabella to her biological mother, Lisa Miller.</p>
        <p>Judge Cohen ordered Ms. Miller, who now lives in Virginia, to allow her former lesbian partner, Janet Jenkins, to spend alternate weekends and some holidays with Isabella.</p>
        <p>The ruling was a relatively routine one, as higher courts had decided the larger questions in the case. In August, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the two women were legal parents. A few months later, an appeals court in Virginia, reversing a lower court judge there, accepted that ruling. The Virginia Supreme Court has not yet weighed in.</p>
        <p>In April, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Vermont decision.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Ms. Miller, Rena M. Lindevaldsen, said her client welcomed aspects of the decision but believed that she alone should be able to decide who spent time with her daughter. Ms. Lindevaldsen said Ms. Miller would continue to fight for legal recognition as Isabella's sole parent by appealing to the Vermont Supreme Court and, if necessary, to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller and Ms. Jenkins lived together for several years in Virginia before traveling to Vermont in 2000 to enter into a civil union. Isabella was born in Virginia in 2002, after Ms. Miller was impregnated with sperm from an anonymous donor whom Ms. Jenkins helped select.</p>
        <p>When Isabella was 4 months old, the women moved to Vermont, where they lived for about a year before separating. Ms. Miller and Isabella moved back to Virginia.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller, who had refused to let Ms. Jenkins see Isabella since 2004, recently allowed two visits in Virginia, lawyers for the parties said.</p>
        <p>Judge Cohen ordered Ms. Miller to pay $9,200 in contempt-of-court sanctions for disobeying earlier court orders and provisionally allowed a $25-a-day fine to continue. He indicated that he might revisit his custody decision if Ms. Miller interfered in the relationship between Ms. Jenkins and her daughter.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Ms. Jenkins, Gary Buseck, said the most significant fact about Judge Cohen's order was how ordinary it was.</p>
        <p>''These cases should be decided not with a gay exception,'' Mr. Buseck said, ''but with an eye toward what is in the best interests of the child.''</p>
