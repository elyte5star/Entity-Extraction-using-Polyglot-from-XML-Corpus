        <p>In another setback for the death penalty in New Jersey, the State Supreme Court established ground rules yesterday for how a defendant, after being convicted of a capital crime, could show mental retardation and secure a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
        <p>In the 4-to-2 ruling in the case of a man who has yet to go on trial, the court said that if a defendant can convince just one juror during post-trial sentencing hearings that he is mentally retarded, life imprisonment would be the only alternative.</p>

        <p>In another setback for the death penalty in New Jersey, the State Supreme Court established ground rules yesterday for how a defendant, after being convicted of a capital crime, could show mental retardation and secure a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
        <p>In the 4-to-2 ruling in the case of a man who has yet to go on trial, the court said that if a defendant can convince just one juror during post-trial sentencing hearings that he is mentally retarded, life imprisonment would be the only alternative.</p>
        <p>There is currently a moratorium on executions in the state, and the Legislature is considering a measure to ban the death penalty. New Jersey reinstated the death penalty in 1982, but has not executed anyone since 1963.</p>
        <p>The decision clarified a State Supreme Court decision in October in which the court instructed prosecutors that they did not have to prove a defendant mentally fit in order to impose a death sentence.</p>
        <p>That ruling followed a 2002 decision by the United States Supreme Court finding that executing a mentally retarded person violated the Constitution. The 2002 ruling left to individual states how they would determine the validity of a claim of mental retardation in capital cases.</p>
        <p>Monday's decision came in the case of Porfirio Jimenez, a 41-year-old native of Honduras who was arrested in 2001 for sexually assaulting Walter Valenzuela, 10, of Morristown, and then beating him to death.</p>
        <p>The public defender representing Mr. Jimenez, citing the United States Supreme Court ruling, filed pretrial motions asserting that his client was mentally retarded and should not be subject to execution.</p>
        <p>The State Supreme Court heard the case and set up a procedure under which a defendant is first tried and, if found guilty, can then claim retardation in sentencing hearings.</p>
        <p>That ruling left unclear whether a unanimous vote by the jury during this phase would be required to sustain the mental retardation claim.</p>
        <p>Today, the State Supreme Court said in its ruling, ''If a single juror finds that a defendant has met the burden of proof for mental retardation, the defendant shall not be subject to a death sentence.''</p>
        <p>Richard Dieter, the director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, said many states were going through a similar  process in addressing the 2002  ruling.</p>
        <p>On the question of not requiring unanimity on retardation, Mr. Dieter said that New Jersey was now different from most states that require a unanimous ruling on the penalty.</p>
        <p>''Many of those same states, like the federal statutes, allow a single vote against the death penalty to eliminate it as a sentence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A juror in those states who was convinced of the defendant's mental retardation during the trial but was unable to block conviction has the opportunity in the penalty phase to block execution.</p>
