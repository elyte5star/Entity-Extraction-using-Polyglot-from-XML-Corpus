        <p>The Security Council approved a request from Lebanon's prime minister to have the United Nations commission investigating the 2005 assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, help investigate last week's killing of a legislator, Walid Eido. Mr. Eido died in an attack similar to the one that had killed Mr. Hariri, when a vehicle parked along the same road in Beirut blew up as his car passed. Like Mr. Hariri, Mr. Eido was opposed to past Syrian domination of Lebanon's politics. Preliminary findings of the commission have implicated Syrian intelligence services in Mr. Hariri's murder.</p>
