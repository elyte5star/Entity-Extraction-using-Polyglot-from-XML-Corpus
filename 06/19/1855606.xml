        <p>GROWING AIR FLEET  As the global economy grows and diversifies, the number of commercial airliners in service is increasing sharply. In its annual forecast, Boeing said that 28,600 new commercial airplanes would be delivered in the next 20 years, when a total of 36,400 airliners would be flying the global skies.  ''Over the next 20 years, the center of gravity of the world airline fleet will move substantially toward the Asia-Pacific region,'' Boeing said in a report issued before the Paris air show this week. More than a third of the aircraft will be delivered to Asia-Pacific airlines, compared with about a quarter for North America. Within 20 years, the domestic market in China alone will increase to more than half the size of the domestic United States market, from its current one-fifth of the United States market,  Boeing said. The company has been outpacing its rival Airbus in selling wide-body and other long-haul jets, including the 787, which is scheduled for initial deliveries next year.</p>
        <p>RITZ-CARLTON OPENING IN MOSCOW  Quick, someone check to see if Lenin is spinning in his tomb in Red Square, because a luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel with rooms starting at $1,000 a night is opening July 1 around the corner on historic Tverskaya Street. Guests staying in July and August can obtain lower promotional rates, Ritz-Carlton said. The 334-room hotel, Ritz-Carlton's first property in Russia,  cost $350 million. ''Having such an impressive presence in Moscow is part of our ongoing strategy to develop world-class hotels in cities where the economy is growing and the demand for luxury lodging is high,'' said Simon F. Cooper, president of Ritz-Carlton.</p>

        <p>CHICAGO-TO-LONDON BUSINESS CLASS Silverjet, the start-up discount all-business-class carrier that now flies between Newark and Luton Airport in London, said that it plans to begin service between Chicago and London in November. Silverjet, one of a handful of new all-business-class carriers that have started flying the lucrative trans-Atlantic market, uses 767 aircraft outfitted with 100 business-class seats. It has two 767s and plans to acquire more this year as it expands. Besides Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami are possible new departure cities, according to Silverjet's co-founder, Lawrence Hunt.</p>
        <p>QATAR ADDS NEWARK  As travel between the United States and the Middle East surges, Qatar Airways says that it is starting four-times-a-week service between Doha and Newark Liberty International Airport on June 26, with a connection in Geneva. The rapidly growing airline said that its fleet would double to 110 aircraft by 2015. It is buying 80 Airbus A350s and 22 Boeing 777s, and has ordered four A380s, the so-called superjumbo airliner. The airline said that it expected delivery of the A350s and 777s starting late this year, and the A380s starting in 2009 to coincide with the opening of the  Doha International Airport.</p>
        <p>CELLPHONE LOT AT J.F.K.  Kennedy International Airport opened a lot where drivers can await cellphone calls from arriving passengers who are ready to be picked up. The 70-space lot, which is free, is near the airport entrance just off the Van Wyck Expressway, about five minutes from all terminals. At  most airports, drivers have to circle around frequently or find an off-airport site to park to await the call from an arriving passenger because of strict security regulations about waiting in vehicles outside of terminals.</p>
        <p>MORE VERY LIGHT JETS  As new so-called very light jets begin entering service, regions outside the United States are taking notice. Adam Aircraft said that it has an order for 50 of its Adam Aircraft A700s from a Chinese company, Hainan Zhong Hang Tai General Aviation Airlines. The Chinese company's chairman, Jason Fan, cited the ''fast-growing general aviation market in China'' for the orders, which, he said, were made with ''fractional share program and air-taxi operation in mind.'' Adam, whose A700s cost about $2.2 million apiece, is one of about a dozen aircraft manufacturers making very light jets. Adam has about 400 orders for the planes, which can carry seven people.</p>
        <p>NEW TRAVEL NETWORKING SITE  Looking for traveler community networking and reviews? A new site, Iloho.com, focused on user-generated news and reviews, started yesterday in a partnership with flyertalk.com and the WebFlyer Network, founded by the frequent flier expert Randy Petersen.
