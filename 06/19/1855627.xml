        <p>Most stocks fell yesterday for the first time in four days after confidence in the home building industry dropped to a 16-year low, renewing concern that the housing slump was not over.</p>
        <p>The deteriorating housing industry, combined with a six-week advance in bond yields, prompted concern that higher borrowing costs would restrain consumers and businesses.</p>
        <p>''Stocks are still nervous about what higher interest rates mean to the economy and the market,'' said Richard S. Campagna at Provident Investment Counsel in Pasadena, Calif. ''The market's worried about every little move.''</p>
        <p>The losses were limited after energy shares rallied, as oil rose to a nine-month high. Transportation stocks declined on crude oil's advance.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.86 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,531.05. The Dow Jones industrial average decreased 26.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,612.98. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.11 points, to 2,626.60. The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for smaller companies, dropped 0.2 percent, to 846.28.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index of sentiment declined to 28 this month from 30 in May, the Washington-based home builders' association said. Readings below 50 indicate most respondents in the survey view conditions as poor.</p>
        <p>The Lennar Corporation, the largest United States builder by revenue, fell 57 cents to $41.19. The Centex Corporation dropped 66 cents to $43.13. Beazer Homes USA retreated 96 cents to $30.82.</p>
        <p>Wendy's International, the hamburger chain, slid $1.47 to $38.26. Wendy's, which put itself up for sale in April, reduced its profit forecast for the year, raising speculation the company might have trouble finding buyers.</p>
        <p>Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.09 to $69.09 a barrel in New York after Nigerian unions planned a strike this week, threatening supplies from Africa's biggest producer. Exxon Mobil gained 42 cents to $86.36. Chevron increased 22 cents to $83.39. A gauge of energy producers in the S.&amp; P. 500 added 0.3 percent.</p>
        <p>An index of transportation companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 dropped 1 percent. FedEx shares  fell $1.45, to $109.92. C. H. Robinson Worldwide, the largest U.S. arranger of freight shipments, lost $1.43, to $53.33.</p>
        <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which influences rates on mortgages and corporate loans, fell 0.03 percentage point, to 5.13 percent. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose  7/32, to 95 4/32.</p>
        <p>About seven stocks declined for every five that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was 2.48 billion shares.</p>
        <p>Alcoa, the aluminum producer,  gained 28 cents to $41.88. Alcoa may receive a $40 billion bid from BHP Billiton, according to The Times of London. BHP is in the early stages of considering an offer and has not made an approach to Alcoa, The Times said, without saying where it got the information.</p>
        <p>Samantha Evans, a BHP spokeswoman based in Melbourne, Australia, said the company does not comment on rumor or speculation.</p>
        <p>Yahoo, owner of the most-visited United States Web site, jumped 81 cents to $28.12. Terry S. Semel resigned as chief executive and will be the company's chairman, Yahoo said. The company's co-founder, Jerry Yang, was named chief executive. The shares jumped $1.20, to $29.32, in extended trading.</p>
        <p>Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:</p>
