Turner Classic Movies is paying tribute to this actress, director, writer and producer throughout June; tonight a series of her performances will be showcased, starting with this 1952 drama about a police detective (Robert Ryan) who helps a blind girl (Ms. Lupino, above with Mr. Ryan) whose brother has been murdered. Next, at 9:30 p.m., is ''While the City Sleeps'' (1956); at 11:15 p.m. Ms. Lupino plays a widow terrorized by a deranged handyman in ''Beware, My Lovely'' (1952); and at 12:45 a.m. comes ''Ladies in Retirement'' (1941), an understated thriller about women living on the moors.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (22, 26) NOVA: BONE DIGGERS A newly discovered cave beneath the Nullarbor Plain in Australia offers a trove of archaeological treasures, including the first complete skeleton of the largest carnivorous marsupial ever found and remains of another long-extinct species.</p>
