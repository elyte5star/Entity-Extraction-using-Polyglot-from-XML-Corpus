        <p>The New York premiere of Edward Albee's ''Peter and Jerry'' and the world premiere of ''Farragut North,'' a dark political comedy by Beau Willimon, are among the offerings in Second Stage Theater's 2007-8 season, the company is to announce today. The season is scheduled to begin on Oct. 19 with Mr. Albee's play, which is two of his one-acts combined: his 1958 ''Zoo Story'' and a more recent prequel, ''Homelife.'' Pam MacKinnon, who directed the world premiere at Hartford Stage in 2004, will direct a cast featuring Bill Pullman, Johanna Day and Dallas Roberts. Next up will be ''Next to Normal,'' a new musical with book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey and music by Tom Kitt (''High Fidelity''). Michael Greif (''Grey Gardens'') is slated to direct. Mr. Willimon's play, third on the schedule, will be followed by a revival of Richard Nelson's 1990 comedy, ''Some Americans Abroad,'' to be directed by Gordon Edelstein. Second Stage is busy between now and the start of the new season, its 29th, though. Sarah Ruhl's ''Eurydice'' is running through July 21, and the annual Second Stage Theater Uptown series is presenting Marisa Wegrzyn's ''Butcher of Baraboo'' through June 30, to be followed by ''Election Day,'' a comedy by Josh Tobiessen, directed by Jeremy Dobrish, which will run from July 16 through Aug. 18. The Uptown series is presented at the McGinn/Cazale Theater on Broadway at 76th Street.</p>
