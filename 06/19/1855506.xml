        <p>An article in The Magazine on Sunday about Dr. Ronald McIver, who is imprisoned for drug trafficking, gave an erroneous account of the trial testimony of one of his patients, Leslie Smith. And a correction in this space on Sunday again referred incorrectly to that testimony. The only point Mr. Smith made in his testimony was that he acknowledged injecting drugs prescribed by Dr. McIver. Mr. Smith never raised the issue of whether he himself sold any drugs that were left over to buy other drugs. And he never referred to Dr. McIver in the context of the leftover drugs -- either that Dr. McIver sold them or did not sell them.</p>
