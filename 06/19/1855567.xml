        <p>A day after President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative party captured a smaller majority in Parliament than expected, France's Socialist Party was struggling to adjust to the awkward reality that its first couple -- Ségolène Royal and François Hollande -- had split up.</p>
        <p>The disclosure, made just hours after the polls closed Sunday night, threatens to complicate efforts by the Socialist Party to close ranks and serve as a counterweight to the powerful and well-disciplined machine of Mr. Sarkozy's new government.</p>
        <p>''It's as if the parents have gotten divorced and now have to decide who's going to run the family and look after the children,'' said Stéphane Rozès, a director of the CSA polling institute.</p>
        <p>The popular tabloid newspaper Le Parisien devoted its front page to their saga, with a photo of the glum-looking pair under the banner headline ''The Rupture.''</p>
        <p>The better-than-expected showing by the Socialists and their leftist allies was attributed in part to a clumsy initiative unveiled by the Sarkozy government last week to increase the consumer sales tax known at the value-added tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy's ministers were under instructions not to discuss the issue until next year, but Jean-Louis Borloo, the economy minister, disclosed last week that the tax increase was under consideration. Then Prime Minister François Fillon made matters worse by defending the idea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy has said  he believes that France creates fewer jobs than other European countries because of the very high ''social charges'' that employers must pay to finance health care, unemployment benefits and pensions for their workers. An increase in the VAT -- now 19.6 percent -- would be aimed at shifting part of the cost away from employers and onto consumers.</p>
        <p>But taxes on consumers are highly unpopular, and the left cleverly hammered voters with the message that these were taxes that would fall on the average citizen at a time when the government was pressing ahead with an initiative to cut taxes on income, wealth and inheritance for the rich.</p>
        <p>In a number of polls before Sunday's election, 60 percent of those responding said they were opposed to the tax increase. The Socialists mocked Mr. Sarkozy, saying his call for the French to ''work more to earn more'' was in reality a plan to ''work more to pay more.''</p>
        <p>Emmanuel Rivière, a director at the Sofres polling institute, said, ''The government truly struck a false note.''</p>
        <p>A former conservative prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, estimated Sunday night that the consumer tax imbroglio cost the governing party, the Union for a Popular Movement, a total of 60 seats.</p>
        <p>But there seemed to be as much attention on the private lives of the Socialist Party's power couple as on reasons for the electoral outcome.</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal, 53, the defeated Socialist candidate for president, and Mr. Hollande, 52, the father of their four children and head of the Socialist Party, used the French news media on Monday to separately spin their stories.</p>
        <p>In traditional French political style, Mr. Hollande called the separation a private affair.</p>
        <p>''I always have been careful to separate politics, which must have principles, rules and foundations, from private life, which must be protected,'' he told France Info radio, adding that the separation ''will not have political consequences.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Ms. Royal portrayed herself as a scorned woman who needed to take charge of her destiny. ''I have asked François to live his life his way, and he accepted,'' Ms. Royal told France Inter radio in an interview taped Saturday. ''This is a separation of fact: we no longer live in the same home.''</p>
        <p>Not one to hide her ambition, she said that the separation from her partner of nearly three decades now allows her to pursue her own bid for leadership of the party. ''I believe we have reached a new stage,'' she said, adding, ''It was necessary to put things right'' before she pursued that position, which Mr. Hollande planned to hold into next year.</p>
        <p>Neither said when they had parted.</p>
        <p>It has been an open secret that the two, who never married, have been less than a couple for some time. The separation was disclosed in a book to be published Wednesday in which Ms. Royal essentially accused Mr. Hollande of having another relationship.</p>
        <p>The new 577-member National Assembly is substantially more female than the previous one; 107 of the new members are women, compared with 71 members in the last Assembly.</p>
        <p>Only 16 deputies are black, 15 of them from France's overseas territories, one of them being George Pau-Langevin, a Guadeloupe-born female lawyer from the working-class 20th Arrondissement in Paris. The only candidate of North African origin who made it into the second round lost Sunday.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the poorest loser in Sunday's voting was Alain Juppé, the mayor of Bordeaux and Mr. Sarkozy's mega-minister for the environment, transport and energy, who was forced to resign from his ministry after his defeat.</p>
        <p>''What you want is for me to feel very, very bad,'' Mr. Juppé told reporters at the opening of Vinexpo, the world's largest wine fair, in Bordeaux. Accusing them of taking perverse pleasure in his defeat, he added, ''You'd be happy if I would die.''</p>
