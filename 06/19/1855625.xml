        <p>In a high-profile mea culpa the Smithsonian Institution issued a report on Monday saying that its Board of Regents had failed to provide the oversight that might have prevented extravagant spending by its former chief executive, Lawrence M. Small, who resigned in March, and other missteps by the organization.</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian also announced that Sheila P. Burke, the Smithsonian's No. 2 executive as chief operating officer, would resign effective Sept. 30.</p>

        <p>In a high-profile mea culpa the Smithsonian Institution issued a report on Monday saying that its Board of Regents had failed to provide the oversight that might have prevented extravagant spending by its former chief executive, Lawrence M. Small, who resigned in March, and other missteps by the organization.</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian also announced that Sheila P. Burke, the Smithsonian's No. 2 executive as chief operating officer, would resign effective Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>The 55-page report was released by the Smithsonian's new permanent Committee on Governance, which also issued 25 recommendations for overhauling the institution's policies, including a new rule that prohibits staff members from serving on corporate boards. The Regents approved all of the recommendations Monday morning, including the creation of a new code of ethics.</p>
        <p>The committee's report said that the Smithsonian had long lacked the kind of institutional monitoring that would have alerted the board to serious problems.</p>
        <p>''With monitoring systems failing to raise the necessary 'red flags,' the Regents' ability to provide critical oversight and require compliance with policies and internal controls was crippled,'' it said.</p>
        <p>The governance panel was established shortly before  Mr.  Small resigned as chief executive  -- the official title is secretary  -- amid a tumult over an audit showing that the Smithsonian had paid for his frequent use of chauffeured cars, private jets, top hotels and catered meals.</p>
        <p>A search is under way for a new secretary. Cristián Samper, who had been director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, has been acting secretary since Mr. Small's resignation.</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian said Mr. Small was unavailable for comment on the report.</p>
        <p>''We continue to express real regret and accept responsibility for the lack of strong oversight for the former secretary and for the Smithsonian in general,'' Roger W. Sant, chairman of the Board of Regents' executive committee, said at an afternoon news conference.</p>
        <p>He presented the report with Patty Stonesifer, chairwoman of the governance committee, and Mr. Samper. Mr. Sant said Ms. Burke, who had served in her post since 2004 and is closely associated with Mr. Small's tenure, had resigned in consultation with the board. ''She believes the institution is best served with new leadership as we move forward,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian consists of 19 museums, 9 research centers and the National Zoo, all of which report to a central management. The report paints a picture of an organization out of touch with itself because of poor internal communications and a concentration of power at the top.</p>
        <p>As a result the Board of Regents was largely in the dark about the terms of Mr. Small's executive compensation, which included a housing allowance and enabled him to use institution money for personal expenses, the report said. The board was also inadequately apprised of negative reaction to some of Mr. Small's initiatives, it said, like a deal he made with Showtime Networks in 2006 to set up an on-demand cable station whose programming would feature Smithsonian programs and collections.</p>
        <p>''The Regents did not routinely receive, nor did they demand, the information necessary to support vigorous deliberation and well-reasoned decision making,'' the document said.</p>
        <p>It said the Regents were unaware of ''critical details'' of Mr. Small's employment contract, the nonuniform application of policies and procedures, objections to some practices of Smithsonian Business Ventures,  morale issues identified through employee surveys and increasing tensions between the Smithsonian's individual units and the central administration.</p>
        <p>Nor did the board heed several efforts to sound the alarm. ''The general counsel, the chief financial officer and the inspector general were without the necessary direct access to the board to be able to raise concerns or serve as effective resources,''  the report said.</p>
        <p>This spring Mr. Small and Ms. Burke came under tough Congressional scrutiny for serving as highly paid directors of the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies even as the Smithsonian renewed a contract last year giving Chubb more than $500,000 in business annually.</p>
        <p>In one of the committee's recommendations senior executives of the Smithsonian will no longer be allowed to serve on the board of a for-profit company as of Oct. 1 -- the day after Ms Burke's departure.</p>
        <p>As for executive pay practices, the report said, a compensation and human resources committee will review the ''philosophy and rationale'' for senior compensation and propose a structure to the board by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The secretary's travel and entertainment expenses will be subject to review by an audit and review committee that will report to the board at least annually. The chief financial officer will also conduct periodic audits of these expenses and report the results to the audit and review committee.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday a separate report is to be released about the Smithsonian by a three-member independent review committee established by the Regents in March to examine the inspector general's reports on Mr. Small's compensation and expenses, as well as on donations. Officials with knowledge of the document, speaking on condition of anonymity because the report has been embargoed, said that it would be more detailed:  about 100 pages and more scathing.</p>
        <p>On June 26 the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is to hold a hearing on the Smithsonian's reform effort and the governance committee's report.</p>
        <p>The reports are being issued as Congress prepares to decide on its annual appropriation for the Smithsonian. The White House has requested $678.4 million for the institution for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, up from $634.9 million in the current fiscal year. The Smithsonian uses its federal financing for operations and upkeep, relying on its generally financially stretched organizations to raise the rest for their programming.</p>
        <p>In its report the committee noted ''serious threats'' to the Smithsonian's financial well-being, including a shortage of money for much-needed renovations and for ''critical programs and activities.''</p>
        <p>The committee also mentioned the composition of the Board of Regents, noting that questions had been raised about the commitment of some members. The 17-member board automatically includes the nation's vice president and the chief justice of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The committee established a new position of board chairman and increased the number of board meetings to four a year from three.</p>
        <p>In an interview Ms. Stonesifer, co-chairwoman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said of the report, ''It's never easy to do this kind of self examination, and we wish we'd been doing it on an ongoing basis.''</p>
        <p>''But it is what it is,'' she added. ''Certainly the importance of assuring the public trust -- and the Congressional trust -- is why we moved at such a pace. We met every week since Larry's resignation to try to make sure we brought forward this set of recommendations so that we can turn the page.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stonesifer said the governance committee's report was aimed at ensuring accountability. ''There is a need for ethics and transparency in everything we do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we had a problem,'' she added. ''The Regents accept responsibility, and we're ready to move forward.''</p>
