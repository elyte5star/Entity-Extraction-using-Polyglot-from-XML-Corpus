        <p>Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on May 2 about the expansion of Latin American companies into the United States misstated the relationship of one such company, Grupo Bimbo, with Wonder Bread. Grupo Bimbo makes and distributes Wonder Bread only in Mexico, where it has acquired the rights from Wonder Bread's parent, the Interstate Brands Corporation. Grupo Bimbo does not own Wonder Bread. The error was pointed out by Grupo Bimbo shortly after the article appeared. This correction was delayed while another question about the article was researched.</p>
