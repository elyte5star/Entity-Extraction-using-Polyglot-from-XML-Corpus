        <p>Torrential overnight rainfall flooded several towns  in North Texas on Monday, killing four people and stranding people and their pets on the roofs of their homes awaiting rescue.</p>
        <p>Creeks swollen by as much as eight inches of rain inundated parts of Gainesville and Sherman, near the Oklahoma state line.</p>
        <p>A 4-year-old girl, Alexandria Collins, died after she was swept away by rushing water in Haltom City, a Fort Worth suburb. Her body was found more than two hours later.</p>
        <p>A woman died in Sherman, about 60 miles northwest of Dallas, after her car stalled in rising water and was swept away, said Sgt. Bruce Dawsey of the Sherman police.</p>
        <p>In Gainesville, a 5-year-old girl and her grandmother were swept to their deaths after the family's mobile home was carried off its foundation and lodged against a bridge above a swollen creek, said Cpl. Mike Linnell of the Texas Department of Public Safety.</p>
        <p>Aerial video showed dozens of people seeking refuge from the high water on a railroad crossing. Families awaited rescue on their roofs, some having hacked their way to the outside from their attics. Some were joined by their dogs.</p>
        <p>About 100 mobile homes in Haltom City were inundated, and many were washed off their foundations, emergency officials said.</p>
        <p>''When I looked out the window, water was up to the bottom of the window and the current was so fast houses were washing away, said Rachel Hawkes, a Haltom City resident. ''You could hear people screaming, but we couldn't get out to help.''</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service said rain fell at a rate of an inch every 15 minutes in some places.</p>
