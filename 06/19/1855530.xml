        <p>Prosecutors pursuing executives for backdating stock options began the first courtroom test of their crackdown as the former chief executive of Brocade Communications went on trial in federal court in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Gregory L. Reyes, 44, the former executive, was charged in July with securities fraud and conspiracy. He is accused of misleading investors by backdating stock option grants, altering company documents and causing Brocade, a network equipment maker, to report false results.</p>
        <p>A conviction of Mr. Reyes on all or some of the charges may lead to more indictments, say former United States government lawyers. Federal prosecutors are investigating options practices at more than 50 companies and have indicted or obtained guilty pleas from eight executives since beginning a nationwide investigation in 2005.</p>
        <p>''This is the case which will establish what is securities fraud in options backdating,'' said Peter J. Henning, a former federal prosecutor who teaches white-collar criminal law at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit. ''If they can win this case, it gives the government something of a blueprint and will help establish where the line is.''</p>
        <p>Timothy Crudo, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury  that Mr. Reyes was responsible for cheating at the company by routinely falsifying company documents to backdate options and make Brocade appear more profitable than it was.</p>
        <p>''It's about deception, it's about lies, and it's about fraud,'' Mr. Crudo told the jury.</p>
        <p>Richard Marmaro, Mr. Reyes's lawyer, said his client was a popular chief executive who intended only to grant stock options to attract the best employees and increase shareholder value. He said Mr. Reyes relied on the expertise of Brocade's chief financial officer, Michael J. Byrd, for accounting matters.</p>
        <p>''Brocade's chief financial officer certified that the statements were accurate,'' Mr. Marmaro said. ''No one at Brocade was trying to criminally defraud the shareholders.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reyes was ousted as head of Brocade, based in San Jose, Calif., in January 2005 after an earnings restatement. He faces 10 counts of conspiracy, fraud, making false regulatory filings and falsifying books.</p>
        <p>Stock options allow holders to buy shares at a later date, usually at the trading price on the day they were granted. Through backdating, companies change the grant date to a day with a lower stock price, giving recipients built-in profits. Unless disclosed and recorded as an expense, the practice is illegal because it hides costs from shareholders and regulators.</p>
        <p>To convict Mr. Reyes of fraud, prosecutors at the United States attorney's office in San Francisco must convince the jury that he knew Brocade should have expensed the options and that he falsified company documents to hide backdating and to inflate financial results.</p>
