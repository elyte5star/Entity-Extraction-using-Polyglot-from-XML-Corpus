        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yes, analytically oriented psychotherapy requires getting past such defensive resistance. I've ''been there'' dealing with the same questions till retiring from prison psychiatry a few years ago. There, an important subtext was the injustice of the ''justice'' system, but was rarely dealt with in therapy. With veterans, it's the unjustified killing. How do you deal with that?</p>

        <p>A field called ''existential psychiatry,'' with a journal of the same name in the 1960s, dealt with such moral and other life-bracketing problems, but hasn't been much heard of lately. I see a need to get back to those questions. Science lost its moral virginity at Hiroshima.</p>
