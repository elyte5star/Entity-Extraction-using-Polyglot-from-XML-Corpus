        <p>A court freed a leading Niger Delta militant who has been jailed on treason charges for nearly two years, raising hopes that a deal to end a spell of violence in the oil-rich region may soon be at hand. The militant, Mujahid Asari-Dokubu, was jailed after he declared war against the government over corrupt practices that stripped the Niger Delta of its oil wealth but failed to develop it, making the Niger Delta one of the poorest regions in Africa's top oil producer. The release of Mr. Asari-Dokubu, a member of the influential Ijaw tribe, has been a top priority of militants in the Niger Delta, who have carried out a campaign of bombings and kidnappings that have crippled Nigeria's oil industry, slashing output by 25 percent.</p>
