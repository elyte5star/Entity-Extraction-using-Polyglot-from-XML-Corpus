        <p>Law enforcement officials yesterday announced the arrests of 27 people accused of membership in the Bloods street gang. In two separate operations, state and federal authorities charged groups operating in Newark and Paterson. Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in Newark, said 13 people were charged with running a gun and drug business from two Newark housing projects. The state police also announced the arrest of 14 men they said were members of another branch of the Bloods, the Sex Money Murder set. They said three state leaders of the group were among those arrested.</p>
