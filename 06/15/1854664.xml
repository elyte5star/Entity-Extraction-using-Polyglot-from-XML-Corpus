        <p>Takes One to Know One  Tracy Williams Ltd.  313 West Fourth Street, West Village  Through next Friday</p>
        <p>Barbara Bloom has operated in the gap between installation and photography for more than 20 years, raising questions about the place of art and women in society with a wry, implicitly feminine store-window elegance.</p>
        <p>Her latest show begins with ''Absence-Presence,'' a little tour de force of display conventions that consists of a four-way roundelay among eight objects, their shadows, related photographs and rectangles of color painted on the wall. The piece creates a poetic yet efficient cat's cradle of connections and cross-references.</p>
        <p>Upstairs more objects, photographs of objects and mirrors that reflect both join the fray in a series of pieces that continue the absence-presence theme, while touching on the rites of confession, marriage by proxy and chickens confronted by their reflections.</p>
        <p>In ''Girls' Footprints,'' indentations in a gray carpet bring to a halt the fluttering movements of convent schoolgirls during recess. Ms. Bloom's work can be a little didactic and arcane, but this show still unleashes a mesmerizing sequence of riddles regarding people, things and levels of reality.</p>
