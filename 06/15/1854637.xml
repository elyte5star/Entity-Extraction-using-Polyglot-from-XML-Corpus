        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Stephen Fell and Will Thompson  Not rated; 101 minutes</p>
        <p>The documentary ''Unborn in the USA'' is billed as a rigorously objective look at the anti-abortion movement, and that's accurate -- but only to a point. The people who are the filmmakers' subjects are passionate, sometimes intemperate and often in-your-face aggressive, and the movie's topic is a powder keg regardless.</p>
        <p>The directors, Stephen Fell and Will Thompson -- who started the film as a senior thesis at Rice University's film school -- show a wide spectrum of abortion opponents, from advocates of violence to fire-and-brimstone soapboxers to a subtler group that takes classes in empathy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fell and Mr. Thompson demonstrate empathy themselves, seeing the world through their subjects' eyes without endorsing their views. They refute silly assertions (particularly one rally participant's claim that her own abortion gave her breast cancer). But they also show abortion-rights advocates as the opposition sees them: as condescending moral relativists who equivocate on issues that abortion opponents consider clear-cut.</p>
        <p>By cutting between abortion opponents raising a billboard and images of a crucified Jesus being hoisted skyward in ''The Passion of the Christ,'' the filmmakers also suggest that this subject is innately unpleasant, and that if advocates on either side bring it into the open and provoke a visceral reaction from otherwise complacent foes, they've scored a small victory.</p>
