        <p>A Russian military court on Thursday convicted four officers in their third trial for multiple killings in Chechnya. They were given sentences of 9 to 14 years.</p>
        <p>Only one of the four, Maj. Aleksei V. Perelevsky, was in court for sentencing.</p>
        <p>The others -- Capt. Eduard A. Ulman, Lt. Aleksandr E. Kalagansky, and Warrant Officer Vladimir N. Voyevodin, who disappeared during their trial in April, were convicted in absentia by the court in Rostov-on-Don.</p>
        <p>In January 2002, the officers, under the command of Captain Ulman, opened fire on a van containing six unarmed civilians after it failed to stop at a military checkpoint in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>The initial attack killed one passenger and wounded two others.</p>
        <p>The officers testified that they later shot the remaining five people, including a pregnant woman, and burned their bodies in the vehicle to cover up the killings.</p>
        <p>Russian juries in two earlier trials acquitted the men, accepting the soldiers' claim they were following orders.</p>
        <p>Responding to protests and complaints from Chechnya's leaders and the military prosecutor's office, Russia's Supreme Court overturned the second acquittal.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court then ordered a new trial by professional judges instead of a jury.</p>
        <p>Roman Krzhechkovsky, Captain Ulman's lawyer, said he would appeal the verdict on his client's behalf.</p>
        <p>''They are all innocent and should not have to answer for a crime they did not commit,'' he said in reference to all of the defendants, the state news agency, RIA, reported.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the victims said he was satisfied with the court's decision, RIA also reported.</p>
        <p>The convictions represent a rare instance when Russian officers have been punished for crimes in a region where the war has ended but there are still recurring reports of torture, kidnappings and murders of innocent civilians.</p>
        <p>Oleg P. Orlov, head of the Memorial Human Rights Center, said antipathy between ethnic Russians and Chechens helped explain why Russian juries had rarely returned guilty verdicts for the atrocities committed during nearly a decade of intermittent war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court's decision to hold a trial without a jury ensured that at least some justice was served, Mr. Orlov said.</p>
        <p>For others, the process further eroded the legitimacy of Russia's already corrupt judicial system.</p>
        <p>''The Kremlin wanted this to be another showcase,'' said Tanya Lokshina, the chairwoman of the Demos Center for Information and Research, a human rights group active in the Northern Caucasus region, which includes Chechnya.</p>
        <p>She likened the Ulman case to the trial of Yuri D. Budanov, a Russian officer sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2003 for the kidnapping and murder of an 18-year-old Chechen woman.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin has used these two cases to argue that law and order has returned to Chechnya, Ms. Lokshina said.</p>
        <p>Chechnya's strongly pro-Kremlin leadership, which has been accused along with Russian soldiers of committing atrocities against the civilian population, praised the verdict.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the court has handed down these very sentences on the servicemen after a long investigative period shows that this decision is right,'' Ramzan A. Kadyrov, Chechnya's iron-fisted president, told the Interfax news agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krzhechkovsky said he doubted whether his client was even alive; there have been rumors that the three might have been kidnapped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orlov said he believed that their friends in the military were hiding them. The question, he said, is ''whether there will be the political will necessary to find these people.''</p>
