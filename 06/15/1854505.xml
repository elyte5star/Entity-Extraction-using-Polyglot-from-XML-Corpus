        <p>The best dances, like the best stories, tend to feel as if a hidden gate had opened onto an unfamiliar world where you may wander at will. ''The Nightingale and the Rose,'' a strangely magical new work by Christopher Wheeldon that will be performed by the New York City Ballet, opens a door onto several worlds. One is the Oscar Wilde tale of the same title that inspired the ballet, which tells of a nightingale who offers her life for the sake of another's love. There is also the world of the fairy tale itself. And a third is Mr. Wheeldon's abundant and wonderfully unpredictable imagination. He burst onto the scene in 1999 with ''Scènes de Ballet,'' created for students at the School of American Ballet. Tellingly, it celebrated their fresh youth and appetite for space, as well as the pure classical ballet vocabulary they were absorbing. He is as much a purist as George Balanchine, the heart of the company, where Mr. Wheeldon is now in his last year as a resident choreographer before he throws in his lot with a company of his own. ''The Nightingale and the Rose'' also celebrates the prickly attributes of Wendy Whelan (above, with Mr. Wheeldon), who dances the nightingale. Mr. Wheeldon, an admirer of Wilde's, has not produced a comfortably linear version of the story. That might have been difficult, given the composer Bright Sheng's penchant for patches of vivid aural color and heartfelt, sonorous climaxes. Instead evocative images succeed one another much in the way of fairy tales: the nightingale alone in a garden at night; a young man pursuing a silly girl who will never love him; a bird's flight through a dark stage full of whirling yellow and white roses; and gnarled offshoots of a dying rosebush that drink the nightingale's blood to produce the red rose that will later be so carelessly discarded. Deceptively old-fashioned-looking and almost unbearably sad, ''The Nightingale and the Rose'' distills the story and turns it into yet another of Mr. Wheeldon's travels into the terrain that lies beyond the gate to classical ballet. (Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86.)</p>
