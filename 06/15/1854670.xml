        <p>Bertie Ahern secured his re-election as prime minister for a third term, winning parliamentary support for a broadly based coalition that he said would ensure stable government for the next five years. The re-election, analysts say, was a personal and political triumph for Mr. Ahern, who, in deal-making since national elections on May 24, allied his centrist Fianna Fail party with legislators from both the left-leaning Green Party and the right-of-center Progressive Democrats. For the first time, the Green Party will get cabinet posts in an Irish government. The Progressive Democrats, who governed with Fianna Fail for the last 10 years, will have a much reduced role in the new coalition, having lost seats in the national election.</p>
