        <p>DOBKIN--Irma Laufer, 63, of New York City, on June 14, after a tenacious two and a half year battle with cancer. Devoted widow of the late James A. Dobkin, she was the wise, loving and vibrant head of her own family and as well that of her late sister Natalie Grumet, while building an interior design practice in Bethesda, Maryland that made historic inroads in the furtherance of universal design as a concept for interior living for the physically challenged. She will be missed and remembered with love by her daughter and son-in-law, Jill Dobkin Sacher and Gil Sacher, her son and daughter-inlaw, David and Megan Caitlin Dobkin, her grandchildren, Alexandra Rachel, Jordan Ariel and Joshua Daniel Sacher, her nieces and nephews, Lori and Bobby Schapiro and Marc and Joy Grumet, and their children Jared and Lindsey Schapiro and Nicole and Amanda Grumet. Services Friday, 2pm at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave.</p>
