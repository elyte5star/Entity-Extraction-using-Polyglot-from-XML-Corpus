        <p>Banking authorities in the United States and Macao began transferring millions of dollars to North Korea to end a dispute that has stalled an agreement to dismantle the North's nuclear programs, Macao government officials said. The money was transferred from Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in Macao, in the first step to return the money to the original account holders, the officials said. Under pressure from the United States, the Macao government in September 2005 ordered that about $25 million belonging to either North Korean state agencies or businesses with links to North Korea be frozen in the Macao bank. Diplomats working on putting into effect the agreement reached in February among North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea hope the transfer will at last revive stalled attempts to get the North to shut its nuclear facilities.</p>
