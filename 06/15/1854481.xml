        <p>APPLEBY--William R., 92, passed away at home on June 14th. He is survived by his beloved wife Elinor, sons Peter, Richard, and John, by his daughter-in-law Stephanie Raia and his grandchildren Kyra, David, and Gabriel. He was treasured by his extended family including Jim, Susan, Chris, Nancy, Sarah, Eric, Breckin, and Frank Meyer. He is remembered as a loving husband to Elinor, and his late wife Gerda, a devoted father, and a doting grandfather. Billy was a lover of both the performing and fine arts, and a devoted supporter of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He lead a distinguished life and is remembered for his elegant style -never without a bowtie -and gentle nature. He will be missed dearly; may his memory be a blessing. Funeral services will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave at 81st, Sunday June 17th at 11:30am.</p>
