        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-14</p>
        <p>Hamas Extends Its Reach; Government Is Dissolved  The Palestinian territories seemed headed toward a turbulent political divide. Masked Hamas gunmen took control of the Gaza Strip and the Fatah president dissolved the three-month-old unity government, declaring a state of emergency and plans for elections. A1</p>
        <p>Egypt Cracks Down on Dissent  Recent arrests in Egypt may have as much to do with efforts to challenge the governing party's monopoly on power as they do with holding a view of Islam that many Muslims consider heretical. They appear part of a zero-tolerance policy toward challenges to the status quo, political analysts said. A6</p>
        <p>Iraq Tries to Maintain Calm  With curfews imposed in Baghdad and several other Iraqi cities and security heightened across the country, the day passed with few episodes of violence despite the destruction a day earlier of the minarets of a holy shrine in Samarra, sacred to Shiites. An attack on the shrine last year set off months of sectarian killings.  A8</p>
        <p>4 Sentenced for Russian Deaths  A Russian military court convicted four officers in their third trial for killings in Chechnya, where they had fired on a van containing six unarmed civilians. Only one of the four officers was in court for sentencing. The others, who disappeared during their trial in April, were convicted in absentia.  A14</p>
        <p>Gates Firm on Missile Defense  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates made clear that the United States would not alter plans to deploy parts of a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, despite an unexpected proposal by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to use a radar base in Azerbaijan instead. A6</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A16-23</p>
        <p>Clintons Liquidate Trust To Avoid Campaign Worries  The Clintons voluntarily liquidated their blind trust and are leaving the proceeds for now in cash in an effort to eliminate any chance of ethical problems or political embarrassment from their holdings as Mrs. Clinton runs for the Democratic presidential nomination, their advisers said.  A1</p>
        <p>Libby to Serve Sentence  I. Lewis Libby Jr. was escorted by federal marshals out a side door in a federal courtroom in Washington for processing after a judge issued a final ruling that he would have to begin serving his 30-month jail sentence shortly, even before his appeals are exhausted.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>Same-Sex Unions Remain Legal  Same-sex marriage will continue to be legal in Massachusetts, after proponents won a months-long battle to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman.  A16</p>
        <p>Immigration Bill Revived  Senate Democratic and Republican leaders announced that they had agreed on a way to revive a comprehensive immigration bill that had been pulled off the Senate floor just seven days ago.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Report on Student Lending  Gifts and payoffs to universities and their officials by student lenders were far more pervasive than has been disclosed and in some cases were demanded by university officials themselves in exchange for promoting lenders to students, according to a Senate report on the student loan industry.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-6</p>
        <p>New Jersey Budget Fix Costs More Than It Saves  In the past two decades, New Jersey has on at least five occasions granted generous early retirement benefits, and in each case, experts say, the plans cost the state more than they saved, undermining the state's ability to meet its pension obligations without raising taxes, borrowing money or shifting money from other state programs. A1</p>
        <p>Pseudonymous Writer Sued  Since the writer JT Leroy, child of a truck-stop prostitute, was revealed to be the fictitious alter ego of Laura Albert, an obscure young novelist from Brooklyn Heights, a film production company has sued Ms. Albert for fraud, saying that a contract signed with JT Leroy should be null and void.
