        <p>The chairman of the House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit yesterday said the Bush administration was exceeding its authority by offering New York City up to $500 million for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed congestion pricing plan. Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, said he had ''serious doubts'' that the mayor's plan qualified for federal financing under the funds the federal Department of Transportation is proposing to use. But Jeffrey N. Shane, the transportation undersecretary for policy, said the department had ''ample statutory and regulatory authority'' to authorize the money under several different programs. The federal money has been a major selling point in Mr. Bloomberg's efforts to win approval for the program in the State Assembly.</p>
