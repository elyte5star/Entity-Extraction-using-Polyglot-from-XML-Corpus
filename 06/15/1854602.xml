        <p>''The Shame of the Cherokee Nation'' (editorial, June 8) said the Cherokee Nation ''voted to expel black members'' in amending its constitution. The amendment had nothing to do with skin color. Instead, the nation exercised its sovereignty to determine that only those with Indian ancestry can be Cherokee citizens.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Shame of the Cherokee Nation'' (editorial, June 8) said the Cherokee Nation ''voted to expel black members'' in amending its constitution. The amendment had nothing to do with skin color. Instead, the nation exercised its sovereignty to determine that only those with Indian ancestry can be Cherokee citizens.</p>
        <p>In fact, there are thousands of Cherokees of African heritage (including 1,500 who are also descendants of former slaves) who are nation citizens because they have ancestors listed on our people's base roll. All will remain citizens and are unaffected by the amendment.</p>
        <p>Despite the amendment's passage, the nation supported staying its implementation in court. All those disenrolled have been reinstated with economic and health benefits and voting rights pending the tribal court's final resolution.</p>
