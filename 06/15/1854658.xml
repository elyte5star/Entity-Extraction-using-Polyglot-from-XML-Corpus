        <p>The family that controls Dow Jones &amp; Company has rejected a proposed plan prepared by its lawyers, asking them instead to seek stronger guarantees of editorial independence as a condition of selling the company to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.</p>
        <p>The Bancroft family debated and rebuffed the plan, drawn up by its lawyers at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz in New York and at Hemenway &amp; Barnes in Boston. Even so, the proposal offers a look into the thinking of the family and its advisers and suggests a baseline set of demands behind which the Bancrofts do not want to retreat.</p>
        <p>The family had originally called for creation of a panel, named by the members, that would have the sole power to hire and fire The Wall Street Journal's top editors, who, in turn, would have that power over their subordinates. The panel would also name its own successors so that Mr. Murdoch would never gain editorial control.</p>
        <p>The proposal considered this week would have created such a committee, but three of its five members would have been chosen jointly by the News Corporation and the Bancrofts, or a family trust or foundation, according to people who read it. The family would have named the other two.</p>
        <p>But the plan also called for the committee to have some control over newsroom budgets and for a two-year moratorium on cuts in the news staff at Dow Jones, the people familiar with it said. And Dow Jones's current top editors and The Journal's publisher would have been permitted to keep their jobs.</p>
        <p>Advisers to the Bancroft family said that a new plan would be significantly different, but neither they nor family members would say which elements of the plan the Bancrofts objected to.</p>
        <p>Some of them said the essential complaint from the Bancrofts was that the plan, which was under active consideration as late as Wednesday, did not go far enough in safeguarding the pages of The Journal, Dow Jones's crown jewel, from interference by Mr. Murdoch and News Corporation.</p>
        <p>''Reflecting the continuing and extensive input of family members, the draft proposal as of today differs substantially in multiple respects from the draft proposal as it stood yesterday,'' a family spokesman said last night. ''No proposal will be sent to News Corporation until it has achieved consensus among the family members and their advisers.''</p>
        <p>The family has said repeatedly that safeguarding The Journal's independence and integrity is its first priority, though the members are tempted by Mr. Murdoch's $60-a-share offer, a 65 percent premium over where Dow Jones stock was trading before his takeover bid became public. Many family members have said that they revere The Journal and fear for its future under Mr. Murdoch, who they say is not committed to serious journalism, and has bent the reporting of his properties to suit his business and political ends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch has sought to persuade the family that such criticism is unfounded.</p>
        <p>Under the draft plan, Dow Jones would continue to have its own 12-member board, with 7 directors appointed by the News Corporation. The other five would have constituted a special committee with the power to fill four positions: the managing editor of The Journal, who is the top newsroom official; its editorial page editor; its publisher; and the managing editor its sister organization, Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
        <p>The committee would also have been charged with resolving disputes between the news staff and the News Corporation. The draft stated that the three ''independent directors,'' those selected jointly by the Bancrofts and the News Corporation, would have been people ''recognized for excellence in journalism'' or with other, relevant expertise, and would have chosen their own successors.</p>
        <p>But the people who read the plan said there was no provision for ensuring that the News Corporation would not gain financial sway over the independent directors.</p>
        <p>In addition to the provisions about newsroom control, the plan called for the Bancrofts to receive two seats on the News Corporation board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch has offered the Bancrofts an arrangement like the one put in place when he bought the Times of London, which some family members have called weak. There, an indepedent panel can block the hiring or firing of the top editor, but Mr. Murdoch's power to make those choices has rarely been questioned.</p>
