        <p>The Pennsylvania county that is home to the Barnes Foundation, the financially troubled collection of world-class art, has offered to buy the foundation's property as a way to keep the collection in its current location. Three years ago, after a prolonged legal battle, a judge ruled that the foundation could move the Barnes from the Philadelphia suburb where it has been since the 1920s to the city's downtown museum quarter as a way to increase its attendance and shore up its finances. The decision will require millions of dollars of public funds and circumvents the charter of the institution's eccentric founder, Albert C. Barnes, who stipulated that no picture could be lent, sold or even moved on the walls of the neo-Classical galleries that he had built in Merion, Pa. This week, Montgomery County proposed buying the foundation's buildings and land for $50 million or more, using money that would be raised through bonds. Under the plan, interest from the money could then be used by the Barnes both to pay the bonds' debt service and to build its endowment, allowing the art to stay put. ''This is much closer to the wishes of Dr. Barnes,'' said Mark D. Schwartz, a lawyer recently hired by the county to explore way to keep the Barnes from moving. A spokesman for the Barnes said that the foundation had only recently received the proposal and was not yet prepared to comment.</p>
