        <p>The West African man who lost his wife and four children in a Bronx fire in March that claimed 10 lives in all asked immigration officials yesterday to allow him to stay in the United States now that he has returned from burying his family in his homeland of Mali. The man, Mamadou Soumare, 48, is an illegal immigrant, and he received temporary travel permission for the trip. One of Mr. Soumare's lawyers asked the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to grant his case ''deferred action'' status, which removes the threat of deportation. A spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Services said the request is being reviewed.</p>
