        <p>BONCOMPAGNI--Laetitia (Princess). It is with profound sadness that we note the passing of Laetitia Boncompagni of Rome, Italy on June 11, 2007. A deeply beloved member of The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art since 1977, she was a Vice President whose enthusiastic and vital support of the Council and its programs will never be forgotten. She will be truly missed by everyone whose lives she touched. We extend our deepest sympathies to her entire family, and especially to her sister, Viviana Pecci Blunt, and her daughter, Francesca Antinori, of Florence. Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President Joanne M. Stern, Vice Chairman The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art, New York</p>
