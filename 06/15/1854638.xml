        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Isidore Rosmarin  Not rated; 73 minutes</p>
        <p>Any attempt to elucidate the most vitriolic turf dispute of our time in just 73 minutes may seem insanely ambitious, but Isidore Rosmarin, the documentary filmmaker and producer, was not deterred. In ''Blood and Tears: The Arab-Israeli Conflict,'' he methodically traces the battle from its biblical origins to the fragile present through the eyes of everyone from fundamentalist Muslims to committed Zionists.</p>
        <p>Scenes of protest and bombing alternate uncomfortably with the measured tones of most of the interviewees. And while the diversity of informed opinion is laudable -- for every militant voice there is a peacenik, for every Alan M. Dershowitz a Hamas leader -- the cumulative effect is to play Ping-Pong with the thinking of any viewer whose sympathies are not already committed.</p>
        <p>Only between the extremes of outrage and entitlement does the film fully capture our attention. As a Palestinian doctor works tirelessly with refugees and a heartbroken Jewish woman quietly rebuilds a life destroyed by a suicide bomber, this painstakingly nonpartisan documentary places its faith in the facts. ''A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends, but can't accommodate two enemies,'' the doctor says ruefully, quoting an Arab proverb. Sadly, ''Blood and Tears'' is the proof.</p>
