        <p>Julie Wilson gave what amounted to a master class in stage presence at the Metropolitan Room on Wednesday evening. Like Martha Graham late in her career, Ms. Wilson, 82, uses her wiry body as a lightning rod.</p>
        <p>Graham was a dancer, and Ms. Wilson is a singer, but for both women, commanding a room could be as easy as standing there and gazing into space. Ms. Wilson's voice is as forceful as an arm suddenly jabbed toward the ceiling and as concentrated as the image of her counting her fingers while singing ''Remind me to count to 10'' from the Kern-Fields standard ''Remind Me.''</p>

        <p>Julie Wilson gave what amounted to a master class in stage presence at the Metropolitan Room on Wednesday evening. Like Martha Graham late in her career, Ms. Wilson, 82, uses her wiry body as a lightning rod.</p>
        <p>Graham was a dancer, and Ms. Wilson is a singer, but for both women, commanding a room could be as easy as standing there and gazing into space. Ms. Wilson's voice is as forceful as an arm suddenly jabbed toward the ceiling and as concentrated as the image of her counting her fingers while singing ''Remind me to count to 10'' from the Kern-Fields standard ''Remind Me.''</p>
        <p>This is singing as great acting. Ms. Wilson communicates in short, ferocious bursts of speech-song that hit you with directness and intensity, as if she were the Oracle at Delphi. If she didn't draw so freely from her reservoirs of joy and humor, you might feel beaten up by her eruptions of self-lacerating honesty. But she always laughs at herself. She is every woman of every age who remembers having been a fool for love while knowing better.</p>
        <p>Clad in her signature outfit -- a clinging black sequined gown, red feather boa and a gardenia tucked behind her left ear -- Ms. Wilson evoked a magnificent but disquieting double image. Over the last 25 years, through the wonders of grooming, she seems hardly to have changed. But of course she has. Song lyrics are now delivered as spoken dramatic monologues during which she relies on her pianist, Christopher Denny, for continual prompting.</p>
        <p>Despite these pauses, Ms. Wilson maintained a steady narrative mastery. ''The Man I Love,'' for instance, was conceived as a daydream built around the seldom-performed opening verse in which ''Prince Charming is the theme.''</p>
        <p>Her ''Ladies Who Lunch'' suddenly curdles as she redirects her withering contempt for her acquaintances onto herself. The movie-star-besotted fan in ''Mad About the Boy'' initially describes her infatuation as stupid and shameful, but swoons into her fantasy as she elaborates it.</p>
        <p>''But Beautiful'' revolves around a moment of final judgment about love; whether good or bad, it's ultimately ''a heartache either way.'' Those words were shouted. The truth hurts.</p>
        <p>Julie Wilson continues through June 23 at the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district; (212) 206-0440 or metropolitanroom.com.</p>
