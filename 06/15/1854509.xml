        <p>You asked again, yes: For the 26th year Symphony Space is presenting its marathon reading celebrating James Joyce's ''Ulysses.'' And though it has been 103 years since that fateful June 16 when Leopold Bloom roamed through Dublin, this event is as popular as ever, with a plump 12 hours of readings and performances tomorrow, said Isaiah Sheffer, its host and co-founder. More than 60 actors and writers including Frank McCourt, Denis O'Hare, Kathleen Chalfant, Harris Yulin and Dana Ivey will spend the first five hours reading from the book, with a bit of textual explication from Mr. Sheffer and others. Next up is a reading of Joyce's letters by fans like Robert MacNeil, the former newscaster; then a dramatic interpretation of ''Finnegans Wake'' by Adam Harvey, a New Mexico actor with an incredible memory; and the premiere of ''The Antient Concert,'' a new opera by Daron Hagen and Paul Muldoon about a singing competition that Joyce, above, who aspired to be the American Idol of his day, entered. (He lost and, thankfully, kept his day job.) The evening closes with, yes, the traditional reading of the uncensored Molly Bloom, by Fionnula Flanagan. Of course a 12-hour marathon can wear down even the most devoted Joycean, in which case you can unwind much as the author did, with a pint of McSorley's ale in the Symphony Space cafe. Many of the actors stop by too. ''It gets to be a convivial day,'' Mr. Sheffer understated. ''Joyce was meant to be read aloud, I'm sure of it.'' There is only one thing you will not hear, if Mr. Sheffer has anything to do with it: a put-on Irish accent. ''I don't want it to sound like a bunch of people doing leprechaun commercials,'' he said. ''Joyce would've hated that.'' (Noon to midnight, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $14 to $25.)</p>
