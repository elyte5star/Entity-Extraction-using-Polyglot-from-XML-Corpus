        <p>Billy Goddard did his job Thursday, which is to say he walked several paces behind his employer and spoke only when spoken to.</p>
        <p>Goddard was caddying for Colin Montgomerie, who carded a six-over-par 76 in their first competitive round since their shotgun marriage last week, a union that was precipitated by Montgomerie's firing of his longtime caddie, Alastair McLean.</p>
        <p>McLean was on Montgomerie's bag in 1994 when he lost to Ernie Els in a playoff the last time the United States Open was played at Oakmont Country Club. Theirs had been an on-again, off-again union, and their latest breakup became official last Friday.</p>
        <p>The day before, Goddard, a local resident who said he has been playing Oakmont Country Club for 49 years, hit Montgomerie's radar.</p>
        <p>''He called up and said he was looking for a local caddie who knows the course and knows how to keep his mouth shut,'' Goddard said.</p>
        <p>Aside from conversations about yardage, Montgomerie and Goddard appeared to exchange few words. On most holes, Montgomerie walked with his head down, a few paces ahead of Goddard, his playing partners Tim Clark and Chris DiMarco, and their caddies.</p>
        <p>He started well, with a birdie on his first hole, the par-4 10th. After stringing together six pars, Montgomerie made a bogey on No. 17 when his drive found the second cut of rough and he put his second shot into a deep greenside bunker -- he kicked the divot he left in disgust -- chipped out and two-putted for a 5.</p>
        <p>Montgomerie hit 7 of 14 fairways and needed 33 putts.</p>
        <p>''He's been good to deal with,'' Goddard said. ''He didn't play too good today, obviously. He hit a couple bad shots and it really cost him. But he got over it.''</p>
        <p>SNEDEKER HAS FAST START -- Brandt Snedeker won the United States Amateur Public Links Championship in 2003. That same year, Michelle Wie won the women's version of the event.</p>
        <p>Since then, Snedeker, 26, has won twice on the Nationwide tour while Wie, 17, is still looking for her next victory. This year, Snedeker, a graduate of Vanderbilt, has posted two top-five finishes on the PGA Tour and won more than $1 million. On Thursday, he posted his best score in a United States Open, a one-over 71.</p>
        <p>''I was able to just keep my head about me,'' said Snedeker, who chipped in for a birdie at the 12th hole to jump-start his round. ''It's a grind out there for five and a half hours.''</p>
