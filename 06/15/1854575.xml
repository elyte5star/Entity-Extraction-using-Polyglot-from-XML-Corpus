        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer and legislative leaders agreed on Thursday to overhaul a 1921 law that forces municipalities to hire multiple contractors on public works projects, finding consensus where two previous governors could not.</p>
        <p>But the governor and the lawmakers -- particularly in the Republican-led Senate -- remained sharply divided on many other issues with a week left in the legislative session, including Mr. Spitzer's proposal to overhaul state campaign finance laws.</p>
        <p>''Philosophically, we're just in a different world,'' the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, told the governor during a public meeting on Thursday. Referring to one of Mr. Spitzer's campaign finance proposals, Mr. Bruno said, ''Governor, I say this very respectfully, that is nuts.''</p>
        <p>The overhaul of the 1921 Wicks Law, however, is significant. The law has required cities and towns, on construction projects worth more than $50,000, to hire separate contractors for general construction, plumbing, electrical and heating and ventilation work instead of one general contractor to hire and supervise subcontractors.</p>
        <p>The law was originally intended to discourage corruption by distributing contracts on public projects to several companies, but it has been bemoaned by local governments for driving up costs. Unions favor the law and fear that repealing it would mean fewer jobs.</p>
        <p>''This is a positive step forward in addressing the underlying structural problems that have negatively impacted our state's competitiveness,'' the governor said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Under the agreed-upon legislation, the threshold will rise to $3 million in the New York City area, $1.5 million in downstate suburbs and $500,000 upstate.</p>
        <p>''We trust all the players that are involved this time around, and that's why we wanted to negotiate a good bill,'' said Larry S. Bulman, secretary-treasurer of the New York State Pipe Trades Association, which includes plumbers, steamfitters and other groups affected by the law.</p>
        <p>''It was a fair compromise,'' Mr. Bulman said, though he added that the increased thresholds were ''a tough part for us to swallow.'' Mr. Bulman, who said he was asked to join the reform negotiations three months ago, said that Mr. Spitzer's arrival in Albany allowed the bill to go through. ''We had no faith in the previous governor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had called for a full repeal of the measure but said he was pleased by the compromise. ''The agreement announced today will allow over 70 percent of city projects to move forward without the Wicks restrictions,'' the mayor said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The agreed-upon legislation has not come up for a vote in either the Senate or the Assembly, but it is virtually assured of passage next week because of the support of the legislative leaders.</p>
        <p>While the Wicks Law agreement was the most prominent news during the public meeting between the governor and top lawmakers on Thursday, emotions ran highest when Mr. Bruno offered a spirited critique of Mr. Spitzer's campaign finance plan.</p>
        <p>He said that lowering the state's contribution limits -- which are far higher than federal limits -- was akin to infringing on First Amendment rights of citizens. He raised questions about fund-raisers held by the governor and his wife, whom he referred to as the ''missus.'' And he implied that the governor was a hypocrite for offering his top fund-raisers access to him if they ''bundled'' donations from other donors. ''You set a limit on yourself, Governor, at $10,000. O.K.? But you have a fund-raiser to bundle a million dollars and you reward people for bundling a million dollars,'' he said. ''Sounds great,'' he said of the $10,000 limit the governor has imposed on himself. ''Good press release. So what?''</p>
        <p>Governor Spitzer has limited his donors to not giving more than $10,000 individually to his campaign, and his legislation calls for the same limits on other statewide candidates.</p>
        <p>The governor said he was ''as close to a First Amendment purist as you will find, but this issue of campaign contributions is entirely different. This is an issue of the integrity of government.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I think there is an overwhelming agreement among the public at large that far lower limits would increase our capacity to be open and honest.''</p>
