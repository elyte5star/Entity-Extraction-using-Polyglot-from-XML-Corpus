        <p>Editorial welcomes results showing significantly improved test scores by New York City students on state math tests; says verdict is out until test scores are compared to rest of nation, but congratulates Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York teachers on encouraging results</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the teachers of New York are rightly proud of the city's performance on this year's state math tests. New York City students showed gains in every grade tested, outpaced students in most other of the state's big cities and edged closer to the state performance average. That's significant, given that big city systems typically lag far behind rural and suburban districts.</p>
        <p>The new scores, which showed that 65.1 percent of city students are performing at or above grade level -- up from 57 percent last year -- are even more encouraging because they were achieved on newer, more rigorous math tests introduced by the State Board of Regents two years ago.</p>

        <p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the teachers of New York are rightly proud of the city's performance on this year's state math tests. New York City students showed gains in every grade tested, outpaced students in most other of the state's big cities and edged closer to the state performance average. That's significant, given that big city systems typically lag far behind rural and suburban districts.</p>
        <p>The new scores, which showed that 65.1 percent of city students are performing at or above grade level -- up from 57 percent last year -- are even more encouraging because they were achieved on newer, more rigorous math tests introduced by the State Board of Regents two years ago.</p>
        <p>The strong showing may well be the result of the new Regents' math curriculum that gives students more challenging material in early grades. School administrators say that emphasizing special training for math teachers has made the teacher corps stronger. Teachers also spend more time helping students who fall behind and work with colleagues to build lessons from one grade to the next.</p>
        <p>The news is not as good for the city's eighth graders. Only 45.6 percent of them were found to be proficient in math. These disappointing results suggest a need for stronger instruction in the sixth grade, where students may not be getting the skills they need to master more complex, middle school material.</p>
        <p>The new scores won't be considered fully legitimate until New York's students are judged on the federally backed National Assessment of Educational Progress. That's the country's most rigorous exam and the yardstick for measuring state standards and tests. Even so, all signs suggest that the city and state are on the right track.</p>
