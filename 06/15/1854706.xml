        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed four bills into law yesterday, including a bill renaming numerous streets that caused controversy when the City Council removed the name of a radical black activist, Sonny Carson, from the list. The mayor also signed the Safe Housing Act, giving the city broad new powers to go after slumlords and improve housing conditions. The act requires the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to identify 200 buildings each year with the worst histories of emergency repairs and uncorrected code violations and force their landlords to make repairs, or else the city will do it for them and bill the owners. If the landlord refuses to pay, the city can seize the property.</p>
