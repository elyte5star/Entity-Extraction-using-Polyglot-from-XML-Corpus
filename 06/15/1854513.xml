        <p>Jody Oberfelder's new piece, ''The Title Comes Last,'' establishes her as one of the funniest modern-dance choreographers in New York. Performed on Wednesday night at the Flea Theater, this trio is essentially an unspooling skein of pure movement, much of it acrobatic. The dance tells no story. But fleeting bits of mime -- a fist tapping upward on another dancer's chest, a bite into a pear -- work together to suggest much about everyday encounters and the sensual impulses that lurk among them.</p>
        <p>Best of all, there is not a single predictable moment in the piece. The dancers' individuality anchors their pell-mell interactions. Carlton Ward is weary but willing to rumble one more time with the girls. Rebekah Morin is a wide-eyed, subversive sprite. And Elise Knudson is a mysterious player whose duet with an apple speaks clear volumes about the pleasures of sensation.</p>

        <p>Jody Oberfelder's new piece, ''The Title Comes Last,'' establishes her as one of the funniest modern-dance choreographers in New York. Performed on Wednesday night at the Flea Theater, this trio is essentially an unspooling skein of pure movement, much of it acrobatic. The dance tells no story. But fleeting bits of mime -- a fist tapping upward on another dancer's chest, a bite into a pear -- work together to suggest much about everyday encounters and the sensual impulses that lurk among them.</p>
        <p>Best of all, there is not a single predictable moment in the piece. The dancers' individuality anchors their pell-mell interactions. Carlton Ward is weary but willing to rumble one more time with the girls. Rebekah Morin is a wide-eyed, subversive sprite. And Elise Knudson is a mysterious player whose duet with an apple speaks clear volumes about the pleasures of sensation.</p>
        <p>The score includes music by Debussy, the Tango Group and Fischerspooner, and bits of taped text from Fodor's Living Language. None of it fits neatly together, but the music and sounds bump the flowing sections along smoothly. All is illogical in ''The Title Comes Last.'' And that logical illogic is one of Ms. Oberfelder's great gifts. Somehow the sequences combine to create a sense of momentum that is crucial to dance.</p>
        <p>''Heavy Light,'' which opened the program, presented another kind of mystery, namely how anyone who created ''Title'' could have choreographed this work. Set to music ranging from Bach to John King, ''Heavy Light'' was billed as a tragi-comic piece inspired by Horace Walpole's trenchant observation that ''life is a comedy for those who think, and a tragedy for those who feel.''</p>
        <p>Falling and piling newspapers suggested dance by Anna Sokolow at her most dire. But the rest was tedious meandering, though well danced by Ms. Oberfelder, Ms. Morin, Brandin Steffensen, Luke Gutgsell, Ms. Knudson and Mr. Ward.</p>
