        <p>Health officials discovered 35 tiny bones and at least eight skulls at an illegal nursing home run by an unqualified doctor in a suburb south of New Delhi, investigators said Thursday.</p>
        <p>The chief medical officer for the area, the Gurgaon district, Dr. Satyavir S. Dalal, reached by telephone, said the bones were of several unborn or newly born children. ''Prima facie, it looks to be the case of female feticide,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Health officials discovered 35 tiny bones and at least eight skulls at an illegal nursing home run by an unqualified doctor in a suburb south of New Delhi, investigators said Thursday.</p>
        <p>The chief medical officer for the area, the Gurgaon district, Dr. Satyavir S. Dalal, reached by telephone, said the bones were of several unborn or newly born children. ''Prima facie, it looks to be the case of female feticide,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The police arrested the owner of the facility on charges that he was operating an illegal nursing home and that he was conducting sex-determination tests and abortions. Abortion is legal in India, but aborting a fetus because of its sex is illegal.</p>
        <p>After receiving information from an informant, whose name was not disclosed, health officials and the police raided the facility, the Buella Nursing Home, on Wednesday and found the bones buried in an underground septic tank. Investigators dug more areas of the facility on Thursday to search for additional remains.</p>
        <p>''We recovered an ultrasound machine, equipment for abortions and bones,'' Dr. Dalal said. The bones will be sent for forensic examination to determine their ages and sex. A document recovered from the nursing home also revealed names of several women who had ultrasound tests followed by abortions, Dr. Dalal said.</p>
        <p>The Gurgaon district administration recently announced a $1,250 reward for any information that could prevent abortions of female fetuses. These types of abortions are common in many parts of India, where sons are seen as an asset and daughters a burden because their families must pay large dowries to marry them off.</p>
        <p>India's 2001 census showed only 933 females for each 1,000 males; in Haryana State, which includes the Gurgaon district, the ratio was 861 females for each 1,000 males, the sixth lowest in India.</p>
