        <p>Strauss Operas Yield Court Drama</p>
        <p>Descendants of the composer Richard Strauss have been ordered to share royalties with heirs of the librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, right, on nine collaborations, including the operas ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and ''Elektra,'' The Associated Press reported. In a decision made public yesterday, a court in Munich found that letters and agreements between the two men made clear that they intended to share the income. But the judges rejected requests for royalties from record sales and performances that do not include texts. In its ruling, the court cited Hofmannsthal's words. ''A work is a whole, and also the work of two people can be a whole,'' it said. ''The music should not be torn from the text, nor the word from the lively image.'' Payments to heirs of Hofmannsthal, who died in 1929, ceased in 1999 after expiration of a 70-year protection period. Because Strauss did not die until 1949, those rights are still under protection. In their petition, Hofmannsthal's descendants sought at least 25 percent of the royalties and put the amount for 2001 and 2002 alone at $997,000. The Strauss heirs must now disclose earnings, paving the way for a determination of royalties owed. The court's decision is subject to appeal.</p>
        <p>Norwegian Novelist Wins Impac Award</p>
        <p>Per Petterson of Norway and his translator Anne Born were named the winners yesterday of the 12th International Impac Dublin Literary Award. The $133,000 prize, billed as the world's richest literary award for a single work of fiction in English, honored Mr. Petterson's novel ''Out Stealing Horses,'' about an isolated 67-year-old Norwegian widower whose chance encounter with a character from his youth revives painful memories, Reuters reported. Mr. Petterson, 54, left, a bookseller before becoming an author, said, ''With money like this, it can buy a lot of time to write and no hunger for some time.'' Ms. Born will receive a quarter of the prize money. Mr. Petterson's competition included seven books, by J. M. Coetzee, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, Jonathan Safran Foer, Cormac McCarthy, Peter Hobbs and Sebastian Barry. The short-listed novels were selected from 138 that were nominated by 169 library systems in 49 countries. The winning book, chosen by a panel of five international judges, was cited as a ''poignant and moving tale.''</p>
        <p>Despite Settlement, Bias Case Goes On</p>
        <p>Frank Davis, a black assistant director fired from the set of the Universal film ''2 Fast 2 Furious,'' has settled his racial discrimination suit against the studio for an unspecified sum, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Nevertheless, the trial in Federal District Court in Los Angeles continued because the principal plaintiff, the United States Equal Opportunity Commission, decided to pursue the case. ''We are a separate party and when we sue, we sue in the public interest,'' said Anna Park, a regional attorney for the commission. ''We need to be satisfied in any resolution that the public interest is served.''</p>
        <p>Here Comes J. K. Rowling</p>
        <p>Rock stars have their circuits, and the author of the Harry Potter novels has the J. K. Rowling Open Book Tour, which will bring her to the United States in October. The tour consists for four events in Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York. In each city, Ms. Rowling, below, will read from ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' the seventh and last volume in the series. She will also answer questions about the Potter saga and sign copies of the book. In September, at the beginning of the school year, Scholastic, the publisher of the series, will choose schools in each city from which students will be sent to the readings. The events will take place at the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles on Oct. 15; at the Ernest N. Morial Auditorium at the Convention Center in New Orleans on Oct. 18; and at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 19. In addition, 1,000 fans of all ages, selected in a sweepstakes, will receive a pair of tickets for Ms. Rowling's appearance at Carnegie Hall on the evening of Oct. 19.</p>

        <p>A 17th-century Dutch painting valued at $1.7 million was stolen from the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Australia over the weekend, officials said yesterday. The 11-by-16-inch work, ''A Cavalier (Self Portrait)'' by Frans van Mieris, was taken from a small room that was not equipped with security cameras, The Associated Press reported.  Weapons charges against the rapper Fabolous (real name John Jackson), 28, were dismissed yesterday after a prosecutor said authorities were unable to prove that he or three co-defendants owned two loaded handguns found in a car in which they had ridden after a shooting incident that left him wounded in Manhattan last fall, The Associated Press reported.</p>
