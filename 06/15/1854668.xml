        <p>Three Lexington lawyers illegally kept $65 million in settlement money that should have been distributed to their clients, according to an indictment for wire fraud issued by a federal grand jury in Covington. The money was part of $200 million settlement of a civil suit claiming that about 440 people had been injured by the diet drug fen-phen. The lawyers, William J. Gallion, Shirley A. Cunningham Jr. and Melbourne Mills Jr., were entitled to about a third of the settlement but took twice that, the indictment said. The lawyers have denied criminal wrongdoing.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 16, 2007, Saturday  A sports article yesterday about two lawyers indicted in Kentucky on federal charges of conspiring to defraud clients in a $200 million lawsuit settlement with the maker of the diet drug fen-phen omitted the name of a third lawyer who was indicted. Melbourne Mills Jr. was also charged -- but unlike the other two, Shirley A. Cunningham Jr. and William J. Gallion, he was not a part-owner of the Preakness champion Curlin. (Unaware of the sports article, the editors of the National Briefing column ran another one that omitted the lawyers' horse-owning backgrounds.)</p>
