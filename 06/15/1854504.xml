        <p>The organizers of Accordionology, which takes place this weekend at Barbès in Park Slope, Brooklyn, describe the event as ''a three-day festival featuring the many facets of the much maligned instrument.'' Much maligned? At first that sounds right. Everyone has encountered portrayals of the suspender-clad squeezebox geek. (Remember Steve Urkel?) Fifteen years ago public perception was dismal enough to provoke the formation of a group called Closet Accordion Players of America, which still exists. But the accordion has had a good run lately, cropping up in Arcade Fire and Bruce Springsteen's Seeger Sessions Band, as well as in many of the robust ensembles -- specializing in Brazilian forró, French musette, Mexican norteño, Balkan klezmer or Argentine tango -- that routinely perform at Barbès. Jazz audiences have warmed to the instrument too, judging by the popularity of the French-Italian virtuoso Richard Galliano, whose album ''Solo'' (Dreyfus) was released this week. As promised, Accordionology -- an aperitif before next week's jazz smorgasbord, the overlapping JVC and Vision festivals -- will present a multifaceted view of its subject. Balkan music will enjoy strong representation by Slavic Soul Party, a club staple, and Ivan Milev, a Bulgarian master. Sounds of Taraab will play the music of Zanzibar, while the 12th Street Playboys will evoke Cajun country. And then there are the visionary eclectics: Guy Klucevsek, who has a brilliant new album, ''Notefalls'' (Winter &amp; Winter), with his fellow accordionist Alan Bern; Will Holshouser, whose most recent release, ''Reed Song'' (Clean Feed), deftly showcases the instrument's versatility; and Ted Reichman (above, far right), who plays a central role in ''For'' (Cuneiform), the fine new release by the Claudia Quintet. (Other Claudia members above are Matt Moran, left, and Drew Gress.) It's a lot of accordion in one place, but probably not as much as you'll hear next month should you attend a master class and concert series in Manhattan sponsored by the American Accordionists' Association (ameraccord.com). That event's moderator, Dr. William Schimmel, describes it as ''a weekend of questionable, useless and farfetched information.'' Who needs a closet after all? (Tonight through Sunday night, from 7 to midnight, Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10 a set.)</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 16, 2007, Saturday  A pop music entry in the Listings pages of Weekend yesterday about Accordionology, a festival this weekend at Barbès in Park Slope, Brooklyn, misidentified the bass player shown in the accompanying picture. He is Trevor Dunn, not Drew Gress. The entry also misidentified the title of the new album by Will Holshouser, who is playing in the festival. It is ''Singing to a Bee,'' not ''Reed Song,'' which was an earlier recording.</p>
