        <p>8 P.M. (TCM) NANCY DREW, DETECTIVE (1938) -- The latest version of the famous girl detective may be released in theaters today, but Emma Roberts won't be the first to play the young crime solver. Turner Classic Movies runs a minimarathon tonight of films starring Bonita Granville, above at center, as Nancy Drew. In the first installment there's a whole lot of kidnapping going on when an elderly woman who was supposed to deliver a check to Nancy's father disappears. Nancy solves the campy caper, but only after she and her best friend are, of course, kidnapped themselves. The tribute continues at 9:15 p.m. with ''Nancy Drew  Reporter'' (1939). At 10:30 Nancy comes to the aid of a family friend who is accused of murder in ''Nancy Drew  Trouble Shooter'' (1939), followed at 11:45 by ''Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase'' (1939).</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Disney) DISNEY CHANNEL GAMES OPENING CEREMONIES -- After this, the kids might find the Olympics to be a letdown. Every Saturday night through Aug. 25 stars from the American Disney Channel and their counterparts from Disney Channels around the world compete in challenges and games. Tonight the festivities will be kicked off with performances by Hannah Montana (a k a Miley Cyrus) and Corbin Bleu. Other competitors this summer will include Ashley Tisdale, above at center; Cole and Dylan Sprouse; and members of the Cheetah Girls. Phill Lewis and Brian Stepanek of ''The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody'' will serve as hosts.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Discovery) EDGE OF EXISTENCE -- The adventure moves to the Altiplano region of Bolivia.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (FOX) STANDOFF -- Disaster strikes when Matt (Ron Livingston) and Emily (Rosemarie DeWitt, left) must work separately. Bank robbers hijack 25 passengers on a train, but Matt is called away to negotiate a situation with a mentally unbalanced man he has dealt with before. Distracted by his worry for Emily, who believes the train heist is more than it seems, Matt blames himself when things go wrong.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Discovery) MAN VS. WILD -- The survivalist Bear Grylls weathers the threat of gators and snakes (to say nothing of the pterodactyl-size mosquitoes) to teach us how to stay alive in the waters of the Florida Everglades.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) FASHION FANATIC: WEDDING ATTIRE -- On the day you remember for the rest of your life, making the right style choices is vital. Stacy London of ''What Not to Wear'' guides the prospective bride through the most important (and likely most expensive) fashion calls she may ever make, from rings to gowns.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (TLC) MIND YOUR MANNERS -- Knowing how to party does not make you an ideal guest. Etiquette experts help three rude and crude students learn to behave.</p>
