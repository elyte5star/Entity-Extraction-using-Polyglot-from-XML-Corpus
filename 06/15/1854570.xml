        <p>Wall Street firms insisted for months that the meltdown in the subprime housing market was contained -- and might even offer substantial opportunities for making profits. The market seems to have come back to bite them.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Goldman Sachs reported that profits were flat from a year ago, as the weak mortgage market helped drive down fixed-income revenues by 24 percent. Bear Stearns, a smaller firm but one with significant market share in the mortgage market, reported a 10 percent drop in net income, excluding a one-time charge, also largely the result of the tepid mortgage market.</p>
        <p>''The decline in mortgage revenues reflects the difficulty in the market around subprime, heightened underwriting standards and reduced securitization volumes,'' Sam Molinaro, the Bear Stearns chief financial officer, said.</p>
        <p>David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said he did not expect the subprime market ''to get better for a little while.''</p>
        <p>But the continued buyout boom and strength in the global economy helped insulate the bottom lines at the banks. Over all, Goldman reported profit of $2.3 billion, or $4.93 a diluted share, up 3 percent from a year ago, and down 26 percent from a very strong first quarter. Bear Stearns reported earnings of $362 million, or $2.52 a diluted share, down more than 32 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding a $227 million noncash charge, earnings would have been $486 million, down 10 percent from the second quarter of 2006.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Lehman Brothers reported earnings of $1.3 billion, or $2.21 a share, a 31 percent increase from the same quarter in 2006. Fixed-income revenues fell 14 percent from a year ago, while equities, investment banking and asset management revenues increased substantially, compared with both a year ago and last quarter.</p>
        <p>''They all three had weaker results in mortgages because volumes are very lean in the March to May period,'' said David Trone, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. ''We saw no real signs of any major credit marks that would have created bigger problems and the rest of the business was very strong, including investment banking and asset management.''</p>
        <p>Mixed trends are influencing the banks' earnings. On the one hand, the global glut in liquidity is fueling a boom in buyouts, which, in turn, is helping every bank underwrite debt, advise on deals and for some, like Goldman, invest in those deals as well.</p>
        <p>Every bank reported investment banking backlogs that exceeded previous records and asset management numbers were strong at all three banks.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, commodity markets are not growing at the warp speed pace they were, volatility in some areas of trading has been low and the mortgage market has been hammered after exuberance that led to slack underwriting standards. That is now resulting in rising default rates.</p>
        <p>Subprime loans entering foreclosure rose to a five-year high of 2.43 percent, up from 2 percent in the previous quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
        <p>Wall Street buys up mortgages, pools them and sells them as bonds to investors. Right now, there are fewer mortgages to buy and fewer investors seeking the pooled mortgage securities. In addition, Wall Street faces the risk of owning the mortgages before they are packaged and sold off. All areas of activity -- now inactivity -- have hurt the banks.</p>
        <p>According to Inside Mortgage Finance, Bear Stearns was the No. 5 underwriter of mortgage securities in 2005 and No. 4 through the first quarter of 2007.</p>
        <p>A set of Bear Stearns hedge funds are in the process of trying to sell a highly leveraged portfolio of bonds backed by subprime mortgages, according to two people briefed on the situation. The portfolio, worth $4 billion to $6 billion leveraged, is down about 23 percent and recently suspended redemptions, prohibiting investors from getting their money back. A Bear Stearns spokesman declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The fixed-income portion of Wall Street earnings is a focal point for investors because it has contributed an increasing portion of the banks' revenues and profits in recent years. Goldman Sachs' fixed-income revenues have enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 29 percent since 2002, according to Mr. Trone, including a 34 percent increase in 2006 over 2005 (and a substantial 21 percent increase in 2005 over the previous year). Mr. Trone said he expected that the pace of that growth would settle to something closer to 10 percent.</p>
        <p>None of the finance officials at the banks expressed concern about the recent spike in interest rates, suggesting that the market's adverse reaction passed quickly and that spikes occur every year. ''As long as we continue to see that kind of benign environment -- good availability of economic liquidity -- I don't think it will have much of an effect on our business,'' Mr. Viniar of Goldman Sachs said.</p>
