        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo (Silence = Despotism, Op-Ed, June 6) forgets that television broadcasters like Venezuela's Radio Caracas Televisión use a limited public good -- the broadcast spectrum -- and must abide by long-accepted public-interest standards.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, RCTV had a long history of violating those. Since 1976, it had been sanctioned for violations of broadcast regulations, including broadcasting pornographic material. Worse yet, RCTV participated in the April 2002 coup against President Hugo Chávez. Should a broadcaster that threatens a country's democratic foundations be granted the right to use its airwaves to do so?</p>
        <p>The decision not to renew RCTV's license will serve to democratize the media. In Venezuela, 95 percent of media is in private hands, much of it owned by huge conglomerates with political and economic interests. Mr. Toledo seems to equate this with freedom of expression; experience has shown that the concentration of media ownership in few hands shuts out voices and limits diversity.</p>
        <p>RCTV is free to broadcast through cable, satellite and Internet. Its former license has been granted to a new public service television station, whose programming is being created by 10,000 national independent producers. This will offer Venezuela the diversity of voices it has lacked for so long.</p>
