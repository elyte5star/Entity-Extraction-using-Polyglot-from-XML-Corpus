        <p>Cheim &amp; Read brightens up for summer with a dazzling display of works on paper by Joan Mitchell, the American abstract painter who lived and painted in the suburbs of Paris. Among the works on view is a selection of oil sketches on paper from the late 1950s, including the untitled 1958 work above, which all combine a bubbling energy and an angelic levity. Typically, they show a messy arrangement of explosive brush strokes. They are also surprisingly playful. Groups of watercolors and pastels from the 1970s and '80s are not so uniformly excellent, but a showing of early 1990s pastels suggests an impressive surge of creativity in her final years. The '90s pastels have a passionate intensity, so much so that they sometimes look as if they had been dashed off in a couple of minutes with a few rapid but sure twists and turns of the wrist. Then there are the fluorescent colors, which can take a little getting used to for those more familiar with the muted and more tasteful palette of her earlier years. Over all the show doesn't exactly tell us anything new about this artist, but the work is so engaging and diverting that in the end it doesn't really matter. (Through tomorrow, Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-7727, cheimread.com.)</p>
