        <p>The return of ''Last Comic Standing'' to NBC, with a new host, Bill Bellamy (''Def Comedy Jam''), gave the network a boost in the ratings Wednesday, helping it finish a strong second to Fox on the night. Following an episode of NBC's ''Deal or No Deal'' at 8 p.m., which delivered 8.2 million viewers according to Nielsen's estimates, the fifth-season debut of the stand-up comedy competition attracted 6.9 million viewers from 9 to 11 and NBC's highest ratings in the time period in four months. Fox led the night over all with a two-hour installment of ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' which drew 8.9 million viewers from 8 to 10. CBS and ABC shared third place. ABC's episode of ''Traveler'' at 10 (4.1 million) earned the series's lowest ratings to date.</p>
