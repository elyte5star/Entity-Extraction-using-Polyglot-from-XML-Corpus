        <p>BAD SEX POLICE: BBC Radio 4 -- our planet's best radio station -- has a lovely program with a snuggly title: ''Book at Bedtime,'' broadcast on weeknights from 10:45 to 11 p.m. This show is exactly what it sounds like: a series of readings from a book, often a new one, spread over the course of a week. A recent ''Book at Bedtime'' title was Ian McEwan's ''On Chesil Beach'' (see this week's cover). Because McEwan's novel is about a sexually awkward honeymoon, though, the decision to read it out loud made at least one McEwan fan nervous. Writing in The Times of London, the comedian and columnist David Baddiel wasn't worried he'd ''hear descriptions so frank and graphic that they would cause me to swerve off the road in shame.'' He simply worried, he wrote, ''for any author who attempts any kind of elaborate sex scene, because of the possibility that it may come to the notice of the Bad Sex police.'' (Much ado is made in Britain about the Bad Sex in Fiction award, handed out annually by The Literary Review.) Baddiel was relieved to find that McEwan's sex scenes were written in ''grandmaster prose'' -- is that a good thing or a bad thing? -- ''so McEwan buys himself a free pass out of the Bad Sex award.''</p>
        <p>NOT ABOUT YOU: McEwan's novel has gotten mostly raves from British critics, including one from Natasha Walter in The Guardian. But a line from her review got under McEwan's skin -- her suggestion that he views peace activists as ''hopeless na誰fs.'' McEwan fired off a letter to the newspaper, now posted on his Web site, in which he lays out at length his left-wing credentials (''When she was still at her primary school I was campaigning, writing and speaking against nuclear weapons'') before writing about fiction in general: ''You don't have to think the central character is nice; the views of the characters don't have to be yours, and are not necessarily those of the author; a novel is not always all about you.'' (Ouch.) McEwan said he does agree with Henry Perowne, the protagonist of his previous novel, ''Saturday,'' that ''some -- not all -- peace protesters are na誰ve. Who can forget those daft and earnest English folk parading through central London last summer with placards that read, 'We are all Hezbollah now'?'' McEwan's novel does not appear (yet) on this list. Three of his previous novels have done so: ''Amsterdam'' in 1999, ''Atonement'' in 2002 and ''Saturday'' in 2005.</p>
        <p>FALLING FOR IT: Don DeLillo's ''Falling Man'' is new on the fiction list at No. 15. Its reviews have generally been strong, too. The novel was wittily skewered, though, in The Guardian's ''disgested read'' column, in which a new book is boiled down to a few hundred words. In The Guardian's version of ''Falling Man,'' one character says: ''Nobody talks like this. So why are we having this absurd conversation?'' Another responds: ''Because we're in an important post-9/11 literary event.'' And here's The Guardian's synthesis of DeLillo's prose: ''Up above the New York skyline, she saw a man dangling from a rope. It was a performance artist. The Falling Man. Lianne felt her guts cramp with poignancy. The image of the towers. He was falling. She was falling. And the critics would certainly fall for it.''</p>
