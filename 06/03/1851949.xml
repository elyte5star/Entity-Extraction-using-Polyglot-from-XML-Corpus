        <p>TRASH MOUNTAIN</p>
        <p>The News -- Climbers from Japan and Nepal removed about 1,100 pounds of garbage from Mount Everest.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The world's highest mountain, at 29,028 feet, has also been called the world's highest garbage dump. Over the years, would-be summiteers have left behind tons of trash -- tents, oxygen bottles, pots, stoves and other junk, not to mention the corpses of dozens of climbers. The Japanese climber Ken Noguchi says his teams have hauled 19,800 pounds of garbage in five trips since 2000. This year, he says, ''the amount of waste left on the mountain has been drastically decreased.''</p>
        <p>SPACE DEBRIS</p>
        <p>The News -- Two Russian cosmonauts erected protection panels on the International Space Station to shield it from space debris.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The cosmonauts spent about five and a half hours outside setting up the protective panels. Scientists consider space debris, which includes discarded rocket parts and small rocks, to be the biggest threat to the space station, which orbits 220 miles above Earth. NASA says about 11,000 human-created objects larger than 10 centimeters -- about 4 inches -- are in orbit, plus another 100,000 particles between a centimeter and 10 centimeters in size.</p>
        <p>CALL IN THE BULLDOZERS</p>
        <p>The News -- Officials in India said Wednesday they are seeking developers to demolish the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The slum's tin shanties and garbage-strewn alleys lie on prime land in the heart of the city. Perhaps one million people live in Dharavi, but the city counts just 56,000 families. The United Nations estimates there is 1 toilet per 1,440 people. Mumbai wants to build new housing, shopping, schools and hospitals as part of a $2.3 billion project. Residents will be offered free 225-square-foot apartments, but some say they fear they will end up with nothing.</p>
        <p>SPAMALOT NO MORE</p>
        <p>The News -- Federal authorities in Seattle arrested a man they say is one of the world's most prolific e-mail spammers.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Robert Alan Soloway, 27, was accused of using networks of compromised computers to send out millions of spam e-mails. Mr. Soloway advertised that he could send out 20 million e-mails over 15 days for $495, according to the federal indictment. He pleaded not guilty to charges of mail, wire and e-mail fraud and other crimes. ''He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world,'' said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft lawyer. ''He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day.''</p>
        <p>NO WHERE LEFT TO GO</p>
        <p>The News -- Tons of garbage piled up on the streets of Naples, Italy, after the only working dump in the area closed.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Italy's president warned of an ''ecological and health disaster'' in the country's third-largest city. The city's neighborhoods have resisted efforts to build incinerators, recycling centers and new trash sites as existing dumps filled up. One nearby town has opened its dump for 20 days to take some trash, but after that, who knows? Many residents are burning their refuse or leaving it to rot. ''This is a situation that is tied to the incapability of the political structure,'' said one politician.</p>
