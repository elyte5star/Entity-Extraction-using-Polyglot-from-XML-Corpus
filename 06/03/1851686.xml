        <p>The Baryshnikov Arts Center is presenting a series of free, informal chamber concerts underwritten by Movado. PEDJA MUZIJEVIC, the pianist who runs the series, has been able to lure several first-class soloists and ensembles, often for programs that move off the beaten path. This week the soprano LUCY SHELTON and Mr. Muzijevic join the BRENTANO STRING QUARTET for a program that includes George Crumb's ''Apparition'' and the Brahms Piano Quintet. Tuesday at 7 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (917) 934-4966, baryshnikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required.</p>
        <p>LEON BOTSTEIN'S AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA closes its season Sunday with a program devoted to music by Shostakovich and his lesser-known contemporary and friend Mieczyslaw Weinberg. Weinberg was born in Warsaw and moved to the Soviet Union to escape the Nazis in 1939 but was imprisoned by Stalin in the 1950s. Shostakovich, who admired Weinberg's First Symphony, helped get him released. Mr. Botstein is conducting two large works by Weinberg, the Symphony No. 6 (he wrote 26 of them) and the Trumpet Concerto. Shostakovich is represented by his Symphony No. 13, with its searing setting of Yevgeny Yevtushenko's ''Babi Yar.'' Carl Albach is the soloist in the concerto; the bass-baritone Sergei Leiferkus is the soloist in the Shostakovich; and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and the Concert Chorale of New York perform in the symphonies. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $27 to $55.</p>
