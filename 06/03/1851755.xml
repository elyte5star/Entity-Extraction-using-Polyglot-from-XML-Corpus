        <p>The neon frankfurter on the front window, nestled neatly in a bun, would seem to say all you need to know regarding Capitol Lunch. It's true, hot dogs are the primary business of this barebones place, which grills thousands of them every week.</p>
        <p>Talk to a local, though, and you'll probably hear that in New Britain, at least, a hot dog is about more than just a wiener. Indeed, Cappie dogs, as they are known at Capitol Lunch, are also about the Famous Sauce. For $1.50, you can have your crispy-skinned frank draped in a thick, brown, clove-accented meat sauce, which, along with chopped onions and a lather of mustard and ketchup, makes for quite a satisfying bite.</p>

        <p>The neon frankfurter on the front window, nestled neatly in a bun, would seem to say all you need to know regarding Capitol Lunch. It's true, hot dogs are the primary business of this barebones place, which grills thousands of them every week.</p>
        <p>Talk to a local, though, and you'll probably hear that in New Britain, at least, a hot dog is about more than just a wiener. Indeed, Cappie dogs, as they are known at Capitol Lunch, are also about the Famous Sauce. For $1.50, you can have your crispy-skinned frank draped in a thick, brown, clove-accented meat sauce, which, along with chopped onions and a lather of mustard and ketchup, makes for quite a satisfying bite.</p>
        <p>Capitol Lunch was established in 1929 as an offshoot of a shoeshine shop that used hot dogs to attract business, according to company lore, and the recipe for the sauce has changed little since then, said Gus Ververis, the owner.</p>
        <p>The same might be said of the clean, brightly lighted establishment, except that Capitol Lunch has moved twice over the years. This location, its largest, seats 60, mostly at Formica-topped tables.</p>
        <p>Patrons line up to place their orders at the counter, where a five-person team assembles and distributes them on cafeteria trays. The menu board, positioned behind the grill, also lists hamburgers ($1.65) and cheeseburgers ($1.85), French fries and onion rings ($1.09 each), chocolate chip cookies and slices of pie ($1.95 for apple, banana cream or chocolate cream), and a variety of soft drinks.</p>
        <p>Then there's the Famous Sauce: Pints to go ($6) will keep in your refrigerator for about a week, Mr. Ververis says.</p>
        <p>Capitol Lunch, 510 Main Street, New Britain; (860) 229-8237 or www.capitollunch.com. Open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
