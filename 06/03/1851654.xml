        <p>THE BASICS</p>
        <p>If it were the Bangkok NYC, you'd know to expect visual allusions to Asian temples. If it were the Rio de Janeiro NYC, you could safely assume a palm frond here, some other nod to the tropics over there. But the London NYC? What ready, easy design aesthetic can it tap? Will the bellhops dress like Buckingham Palace guards, and will a replica of Big Ben cast a shadow over the lobby? This being New York instead of Vegas, no. The London NYC doesn't pretend that the Hudson is the Thames and get overly cute with its advertised Anglophilia. It just names itself for a European capital that's enjoying a special international vogue right now; installs a restaurant affiliated with one of England's most celebrated chefs, Gordon Ramsay; then follows the dictates of good taste, not geography.</p>
        <p>THE LOCATION</p>
        <p>The Midtown neighborhood of the hotel, which used to be the Rihga Royal, isn't particularly romantic or fashionable. But for all-purpose convenience, it's hard to beat. A business traveler has a quick walk to offices on the Avenue of the Americas. A shopper is just as well positioned, with Fifth Avenue stores in one direction, the Time Warner Center in the other. And a righteous exerciser has Central Park close at hand -- or rather foot.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS</p>
        <p>Accustomed to absurdly cramped Manhattan hotel rooms, I couldn't quite get over how much space I had at the London NYC, an all-suite property, considering that my weekend rate was less than $400 a night before taxes and other surcharges. (Standard rates vary from $399 to $899.) The octagonal living room had a kidney-shaped sectional sofa on which at least four people could comfortably sit, a round coffee table that could be elevated to function as a dining table, an enormous desk with a proper desk chair, and enough floor space left over for a Pilates session, had I been so inclined. There was a flat-screen television not only in this room, but also in the bedroom, reached via mirrored French doors. Both rooms were decorated in an understated, handsome brown-and-tan scheme.</p>
        <p>THE BATHROOMS</p>
        <p>Again, startlingly big. Very white, too, its walls and floors made of hand-cut glass tiles. Most impressive: the long shower, with two heads, at opposite ends, so two people can shower at once, or one can do little laps between different sprays of water. No bathtub, though.</p>
        <p>AMENITIES</p>
        <p>The hotel is building a fitness center, scheduled for this summer, and needs one. What now serves as its gym is a series of depressing fourth-floor rooms with gray carpeting, low ceilings and oddly grouped weight and cardio machines.</p>
        <p>ROOM SERVICE</p>
        <p>Guests can order from an abbreviated version of the restaurant's menu. When I did, the food, including a sunchoke risotto and a peekytoe crab salad, was as good as it had been in the restaurant. It was pricey, though: dinner for two with wine can easily exceed $150. The meal arrived within 30 minutes and was arrayed beautifully on that rising coffee table. I went out without leaving my completed breakfast card on the doorknob, called the hotel and asked if someone could get it from the desk and submit it. Someone did, and breakfast came right on schedule.</p>
        <p>BOTTOM LINE</p>
        <p>The owners, LXR Luxury Resorts, have fashioned a smartly and indulgently up-to-the-minute space. But there were lapses in the usually good service. While the hotel boasts of concierge services from the firm Quintessentially, my one approach to the concierge desk -- to ask about faxing something -- prompted a belligerent bark from the man on duty and an eye roll from two nearby employees who had apparently witnessed his charm before.</p>
