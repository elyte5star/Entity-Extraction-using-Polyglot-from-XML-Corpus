        <p>Editorial questions whether proposals by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to make MySpace social networking site safer for young users would be viable; holds sites should require users under 18 to take Internet safety course before they are allowed to create Web pages</p>

        <p>MySpace.com, the Internet social networking site, has gained tens of millions of users in the four short years it has been in business. But as users have multiplied, creating their own web pages on the site, rare but troubling incidents have increased, too. Sexual assailants have monitored MySpace Web sites to prey upon minors who ill-advisedly post highly personal information about themselves.</p>
        <p>That's one reason the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, led a coalition of attorneys general from several states to demand that MySpace do more to make its site safer for children. The group persuaded the company to remove the Web pages of 7,000 known sexual predators. My Space.com also says it supports state and federal legislation to force sexual offenders to register their e-mail addresses with law enforcement authorities, or risk up to five years in prison.</p>

        <p>MySpace.com, the Internet social networking site, has gained tens of millions of users in the four short years it has been in business. But as users have multiplied, creating their own web pages on the site, rare but troubling incidents have increased, too. Sexual assailants have monitored MySpace Web sites to prey upon minors who ill-advisedly post highly personal information about themselves.</p>
        <p>That's one reason the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, led a coalition of attorneys general from several states to demand that MySpace do more to make its site safer for children. The group persuaded the company to remove the Web pages of 7,000 known sexual predators. My Space.com also says it supports state and federal legislation to force sexual offenders to register their e-mail addresses with law enforcement authorities, or risk up to five years in prison.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Blumenthal and others want MySpace to check the age of people who use the site, including children, and raise the minimum age for registered users to 16 from the current 14.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal has done the company a favor by his insistence that more safeguards be put in place. But it is not clear that children's ages can be verified without violating the privacy of school records or Social Security numbers, especially since minors rarely have widely-accepted identification.</p>
        <p>Yet another possibility, Mr. Blumenthal suggests, is to require parental consent for children to register their profiles on the site. But critics say predators could simply create fake Internet identities as minors and use their real names to submit the needed ''parental'' consent, thus making it even easier for them to lure children into social interactions. Restrictive laws could also wind up causing unnecessary regulation of popular Web pages used by bloggers, or sites where people play video games together. A law written with the best of intentions could wind up casting a too-wide net. And there is nothing to prevent Web site companies from moving offshore and out of the reach of American law.</p>
        <p>This is a complicated issue that requires energy from lawmakers, Internet companies and attorneys general. There will not be just one solution to the problem, but several, and none will be foolproof.</p>
        <p>One step in the right direction might be for social networking sites to require users under 18 to take an Internet safety course before they are allowed to create Web pages. It seems obvious, but when teenagers post explicit photos and suggestive information about themselves, they not only invite unwanted attention from criminals but they also diminish their chances of obtaining jobs in the future.</p>
        <p>Parents should also become familiar with Web sites their children are using; software that will monitor what their children are doing is readily available.</p>
        <p>These Web sites are popular because they are fun, enabling kids to socialize with the click of a few buttons. With some common sense, they can be made safer, too.</p>
