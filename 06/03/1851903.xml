        <p>Just inside the front door of the Training Camp sneaker store on West 45th Street, rows of Adidas and Converse shoes in dozens of wild color combinations are lined up.

        <p>The shoppers are city police sergeants, and they have been trooping in to pick up their free pairs of a black waterproof boot called the Boss, which was designed especially for them by Udi Avshalom, the store's owner and a self-professed police lover.

        <p>Just inside the front door of the Training Camp sneaker store on West 45th Street, rows of Adidas and Converse shoes in dozens of wild color combinations are lined up. But for a small group of shoppers, these flashy items are hard-pressed to compete with the understated wares on display near the back of the store.</p>
        <p>The shoppers are city police sergeants, and they have been trooping in to pick up their free pairs of a black waterproof boot called the Boss, which was designed especially for them by Udi Avshalom, the store's owner and a self-professed police lover. Mr. Avshalom, an Israeli native who grew up in Brownsville, is offering the shoes at the wholesale price to the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the officers' union, which in turn pays the tab for its members.</p>
        <p>The sergeants have been picking up the free shoes -- which meet department specifications -- at Training Camp's nine stores in the city. They have snapped up about 3,500 pairs since November, said Robert Johnson, the union's treasurer; the hope is to have all 4,700 pairs that the union purchased distributed by late June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avshalom said the project was intended to repay the police for keeping an eye on him as a 12-year-old in Brownsville -- dealing with him sternly, for example, for peddling shoes on the street when he should have been in school.</p>
        <p>''The cops would help me out,'' Mr. Avshalom said. ''I was in a crime-infested neighborhood, and they always seemed to me like real people.''</p>
        <p>Now, besides owning sneaker stores, he said, he has designed shoes for the athletes Gary Sheffield and Allan Houston and the rappers P. Diddy and Jay-Z.</p>
        <p>City police officers buy their own shoes, which cost at least $70, Mr. Johnson said. He added that they are in a constant struggle with aching knees and backs.</p>
        <p>''You wear a 20-pound gun belt, you're wearing a Kevlar vest, you have all this equipment on for nine hours a day, and that takes its toll,'' he said. It was at a charity event last year that Mr. Johnson ran into Mr. Avshalom, and they discovered they had both been thinking about a new police boot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avshalom said his boots have a comfortable, sneaker-like sole, and a zipper on the side to make them easy to slip on and off. And in a touch his more fashion-forward clients might appreciate, the boots feature the union logo of a gold shield on the side, and three sergeant's stripes on the back.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Avshalom's contention that police officers and hip-hop artists are not so different as either group might think.</p>
        <p>''The Boss,'' he said. ''You know who named the shoe? The cops. Doesn't that sound like the name of a rapper? So how much do these guys really have in common?''</p>
