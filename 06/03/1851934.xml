        <p>Quiznos, the national sandwich chain, is further revamping its executive suite under the leadership of Gregory D. Brenneman, a turnaround expert. Last week he named Rusty B. Spinney, a Molson Coors veteran, as the company's chief accounting officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spinney, 40, was in charge of Molson Coors's global technical accounting, financial policy implementation and Sarbanes-Oxley law compliance. He will report to Brandon Turner, Quiznos's chief financial officer, who also joined the chain this year as part of Mr. Brenneman's executive makeover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brenneman, who is credited with revitalizing Burger King and Continental Airlines, joined Quiznos in January. His private equity firm, TurnWorks, took an equity stake in Quiznos, which is privately owned and has more than 5,000 stores nationwide.</p>
        <p>Quiznos has been sued by some of its franchisees, who say that its practices make the stores unprofitable.</p>
        <p>Some of the franchisees contend that the company requires them to buy food and supplies from Quiznos or its designated affiliates while setting artificially low retail prices for the chain's products, making it impossible to turn a profit. The company has said that the lawsuits have no merit.</p>
