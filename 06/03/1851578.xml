        <p>Sometime in early July, Roz Savage will climb aboard her boat, the Sedna, in San Francisco harbor and pick up the oars for a long paddle westward. Savage, a 39-year-old former suit from Cheshire, England, decided five years ago that she'd rather die an adventurer than an I.T. project manager. Both she and the Sedna proved their seaworthiness during the 2,550-mile Trans-Atlantic Row in 2006, a race that took her 103 days (she finished 20th out of 26 boats; 6 abandoned the race). This time, the task is even more imposing: she will row 2,600 miles to Hawaii, the first leg of a three-part, 6,700-mile journey across the Pacific that will end in Australia in 2009. Here, a look at Savage's quest to become the first woman to row across the big ocean:</p>
        <p>23 X 6  Size, in feet, of the Sedna, named after an Inuit ocean goddess. The 600-pound carbon-fiber craft (which weighs 1,200 pounds when fully loaded) rights itself if capsized. Two cabins -- one houses supplies, the other her bunk -- sandwich the rowing station.</p>
        <p>7  The hour at which Savage will begin her day. She'll check the weather forecast on her laptop and ring her mom on the satellite phone. (Everything electronic, from the water desalinizer to the video camera, will be powered by the sun or wind.) Thirty minutes later, she'll begin rowing: four two-hour shifts divided by hourlong breaks, during which the 5-foot-4, 132-pound Savage will chip away at the 3,000 calories she'll ingest daily. Then she'll nap, tend to her bean sprouts (grown on board to prevent scurvy) or work on science experiments intended to occupy her mind and bring attention to pollution in the Pacific. Bedtime will come around 10.</p>
        <p>0  Articles of clothing worn during a typical day of rowing. Going au naturel not only reduces the chance of a rash on her most delicate body parts, but can be less dangerous than wearing clothes. ''Trying to pull down your shorts to urinate while heeding the nautical rule of three points of contact -- meaning my feet and one hand are touching the deck -- is really difficult,'' says Savage, who deliberately drinks less on her later rowing shifts to reduce the need for in-the-dark visits to the bedpan.</p>
        <p>83  Days on the Atlantic during which Savage had to eat cold food after her camping stove went kaput. This time she'll bring a backup. Some other important lessons: pack wooden oars (by Day 48, each of her four carbon-fiber oars was being held together by duct tape); anything not tied down on deck ends up overboard (lost items included two thermoses, two water bottles, two alpaca seat-covers and two ChapSticks); and salt water and electronics don't mix (even her marine navigation instruments were shot by the end -- ''There's really no solution for this,'' she says with a sigh).</p>
        <p>10,000  Songs on her two iPods. Headphones make her feel too insulated, so she has ''waterproof'' speakers, which she knows will eventually corrode. After that, she's her own jukebox. Two songs that played endlessly in her head across the Atlantic: U2's ''Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of'' and David Bowie's ''Space Oddity,'' about ''floating around in a tin can without communication,'' she says. ''That's what I feel like in my boat.''</p>
