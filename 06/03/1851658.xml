        <p>JOHN HODGMAN may be best known these days for his appearances on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' and in those ubiquitous Apple Computer ads. (He's also a contributing writer to The Times Magazine and the author of a book, ''The Areas of My Expertise.'') For three years Hodgman has also been, happily for us, the Book Review's comics critic. Hodgman has been obsessed with the form, he told us in an e-mail interview, since elementary school. ''If there is one thing that sums up the cultural mood of a certain niche of non-sports-playing boys in the early '80s, it is Wolverine fighting ninjas in Japan as drawn by Frank Miller,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Reviewing comics is indeed different, he explained, from reviewing other kinds of books. ''Having to lend an opinion to both narrative and illustration only doubles the intimidation factor,'' he wrote. ''When a comic is by a single creator and it is good, you realize that you are dealing with a person who has somehow mastered two very difficult and disparate skills and managed to make them operate together.''</p>
