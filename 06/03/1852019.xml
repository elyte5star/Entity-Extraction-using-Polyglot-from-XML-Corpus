        <p>Virginia Loftin has been spending a lot of time on these recent gorgeous days flying along the New Jersey coast looking, essentially, for scum.</p>
        <p>What Ms. Loftin, a research scientist for the State Department of Environmental Protection's Cooperative Coastal Monitoring Program, has found is an algae bloom. It is an intermittent film of oily brown organisms that has stretched, at various times over the last several weeks, from Sandy Hook through the Raritan Bay and on down to Seaside Park.</p>
        <p>''We fly the coast six days a week in a visual surveillance program, monitoring it for anything that might affect our beaches or bathing waters,'' she said. ''We've had a lot of sunlight, beautiful days, cool waters, so it's not unusual that we have an algae bloom.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Loftin said that many people have called the department with worries about the algae boom.</p>
        <p>''It's not a problem, but an aggravation,'' she said. ''It is a natural occurrence, but the good weather and 60-degree waters have caused a greater bloom than normal.''</p>
        <p>Sewage systems along the shore are not responsible for the bloom, Ms. Loftin said, as the counties along the coast have not discovered anything amiss in water tests. It has probably been exacerbated, she said, by fertilizer in runoff from nearby properties, though.</p>
        <p>''If we could do anything to diminish it,'' Ms. Loftin said, ''it would be to use less fertilizer in the first place.''</p>
        <p>She said that by Wednesday, the bloom had receded and would probably continue to diminish in succeeding days.</p>
