        <p>A plan to reduce the amount of water and wastewater going into the sewer system in the Village of Northport will soon mean changes for local restaurants, bars, butcher shops and fish markets.</p>
        <p>The village enacted a law on May 15 that will eventually require restaurants, bars and other places where food and drink are consumed on site to install low-flush toilets and urinals that will cut down on the amount of water used.</p>
        <p>In addition, restaurants, butcher shops, fish markets and food-processing places where oil or grease could be introduced to the sewer system must add interceptors to catch at least 90 percent of the grease, and discard their cooking oils by recycling them. The businesses will also be required to keep records of how often they clean disposal systems.</p>
        <p>Joe Correia, superintendent of public works in Northport, said the new law was an effort to pre-empt a problem in the village, which has jurisdiction over the sewer district and the wastewater treatment plant. The amount of water going into the system will soon increase by about 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The flow of water now averages 380,000 gallons a day, he said, but water consumption will increase with the reopening of a movie theater at the end of June, its expansion to add live theater, and the eventual reopening of a motel and restaurant complex.</p>
        <p>''These two projects will add 20,000 more gallons flowing every day and will put us at or near capacity,'' Mr. Correia said.</p>
        <p>Despite the expense and inconvenience, several business owners said they supported the law. Connie Crespin, owner of Caffe Portofino, said: ''Being a harbored village, this issue should have been addressed a long time ago. Naturally, I don't want to spend the money, but we eat fish out of that harbor, and everybody has to bite the bullet.''</p>
        <p>Maria Maroni, owner of Maroni Cuisine, agreed. ''I not only have my business here but live here as well,'' she said. ''We're lucky to live on the water, and now we need to protect it.''</p>
