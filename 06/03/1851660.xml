        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the author of ''A Farewell to Justice,'' which challenges the conclusions of the Warren Commission, I was taken aback by Bryan Burrough's suggestion in his review of ''Reclaiming History,'' by Vincent Bugliosi (May 20), that those who do not accept Bugliosi's defense of the Warren report should be ''marginalized'' and made to ''stand in the rain with the other outcasts.'' Ideas, after all, are best argued on their merit, and the First Amendment of the Constitution appears to encourage debate even on issues of received wisdom. Burrough apparently has no stomach for the subject, as he attempts to malign inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy as ''one of the left's more wrongheaded crusades.''</p>

        <p>I would have hoped that The Times might have discovered a reviewer less burdened by ideology.</p>
