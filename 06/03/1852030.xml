        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Barbaric Relic'' (editorial, May 27): I left England in 1967 when the death penalty had been suspended prior to its final abolition and have followed with alternate hope and distress the evolution of public and government attitudes here, particularly in my state of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>With the Senate Judiciary Committee vote, hope predominated. Since then there has been a development that had an uncanny parallel in England of the early '50s.</p>
        <p>Then, a young man with diminished mental capacity, Timothy Evans, was hanged for the murder of his child. Although he confessed to the killing, he subsequently implicated his neighbor, John Christie, a powerful witness against him at the trial. Some years later, of course, Christie was proved to be a mass murderer and ultimately Evans received a posthumous pardon.</p>
        <p>Now in New Jersey we have Byron Halsey, a man with severe learning disabilities, who was released after serving 19 years in prison for the murder of two children in his care. Prosecutors say DNA evidence now points to another man as the killer -- a neighbor who testified against Halsey. Halsey too had confessed. Mercifully, Halsey was not executed, although the death penalty had been sought.</p>
        <p>That terrible miscarriage of justice in England did much to change hearts and minds and finally the law. Possibly the Halsey case will do the same thing here. In the name of a fair society, let the full Senate decide.</p>
