        <p>Volunteer firefighters in Larchmont sued the village last week to block the hiring of a paid fire chief, and nearly all active volunteers have resigned in protest, effective this month.</p>
        <p>The firefighters last Wednesday sought a preliminary injunction in State Supreme Court to block the hiring of Richard Heine as chief. They already have an elected chief, Chris McDonald, and they say a second chief, appointed and paid by the village, is illegal, unworkable and presents command risks.</p>
        <p>James Sweeney, a spokesman for the volunteers, who has served with the department 30 years, twice as chief, said it would be dangerous if two chiefs showed up at a fire.</p>
        <p>''Who's in charge?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mayor Elizabeth N. Feld said there was nothing dangerous about the situation. ''All calls for service are being answered,'' she said. ''Volunteers are serving under the chief's direction.''</p>
        <p>She defended the village board's authority, saying the idea of hiring a paid chief had been discussed in the village of 6,500 for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feld said the board had decided it was time to make the department more accountable. With a $2.4 million budget, 15 career firefighters, at least two dozen volunteers and millions of dollars of equipment, the department was also faced with additional emergency preparedness demands after 9/11, she said. ''It's unrealistic to expect that kind of accountability from a volunteer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney said the department had been governed for 100 years by a Fire Council elected by volunteers. The 15 paid members of the department have traditionally reported to the volunteer chief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney said having a paid chief who answers to a mayor or village board leaves volunteers with no say in how the department is run.</p>
        <p>''That's why it's so devastating,'' he said.</p>
