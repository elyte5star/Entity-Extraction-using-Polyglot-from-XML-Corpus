        <p>A second stretch of Interstate-78 will undergo major construction this summer.</p>
        <p>In March the State Department of Transportation began a $42 million reconstruction of 2.3 miles of local lanes on I-78 between Route 24 and the Garden State Parkway in Union. This month the department will begin a $2.1 million project in Bedminster in Somerset County, to repair the I-78 East bridge over I-287 North and to extend the acceleration ramp from I-287 South to I-78 West.</p>
        <p>The Union project is scheduled to be completed in November, the Bedminster projects in December.</p>
        <p>Four of the five lanes in each direction will remain open during the reconstruction in Union, said Erin Phalon, a Transportation Department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>In mid-June the department will close one eastbound lane for the bridge project in Bedminster, keeping two lanes open, Ms. Phalon said. The I-287 South project is not expected to affect traffic, she said.</p>
        <p>The department has placed message signs on I-78, the New Jersey Turnpike and the parkway to provide motorists with traffic updates and estimated drive times through the work sections. The department will monitor traffic speeds by radar and, when necessary, inform motorists of alternative routes via the signs.</p>
        <p>The department will also post traffic reports on its Web site, www.njcommuter.com.</p>
        <p>''It's important to note these projects are 20 miles apart,'' Ms. Phalon said. ''We don't expect a cumulative effect.''</p>
