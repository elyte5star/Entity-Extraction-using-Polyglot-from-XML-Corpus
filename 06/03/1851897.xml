        <p>Like other parents in the Highbridge section of the South Bronx, Yesenia Mercado sees her local library branch on West 168th Street as more than just a repository of books.</p>
        <p>She sees it as a safe refuge for her 12-year-old son, Justin, during after-school hours. For Justin, it is also a place to quietly do homework, pursue research on the Internet and get tutorial help as many as three afternoons a week.</p>

        <p>Like other parents in the Highbridge section of the South Bronx, Yesenia Mercado sees her local library branch on West 168th Street as more than just a repository of books.</p>
        <p>She sees it as a safe refuge for her 12-year-old son, Justin, during after-school hours. For Justin, it is also a place to quietly do homework, pursue research on the Internet and get tutorial help as many as three afternoons a week.</p>
        <p>''The stuff he's learning, it's things I don't even know,'' said Ms. Mercado, who is 34 and unemployed. ''You know, the technology with these kids.''</p>
        <p>But the news that their much-used library will close tomorrow for a two-year renovation has rattled Ms. Mercado and other Highbridge residents.</p>
        <p>''If you go there after 2, you find it filled with children until they close at 6,'' said Anita Antonetti, a high school counselor and former community board member who has been involved in efforts to temporarily relocate some library services. ''It's a lot more than the books.''</p>
        <p>Besides its use by children, the library is patronized heavily by elderly people seeking a place to cool off in the summer, said Ms. Antonetti, and by Highbridge residents who seek the free Internet access.</p>
        <p>Anthony Calnek, the vice president of communications and marketing for the New York Public Library system, explained that the $5 million renovation will add 2,100 square feet to the 8,300-square-foot building and will include expanded children's and adult reading rooms, a community room, 24 new computer stations, a raised roof and wireless Internet service. It is scheduled for completion in the spring of 2009.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calnek said that the library's book collection will be distributed between the Highbridge Community Life Center, a nonprofit group, and Public School 11, and will be accessible during the branch's period of closure. Neighbors are also being encouraged to visit other libraries a city bus ride away, including the Grand Concourse branch library on East 173rd Street and the Melrose branch library at 910 Melrose Avenue.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Calnek conceded that the Highbridge library's closing leaves a gap in the community. ''There's no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Antonetti countered that opening a temporary library with the same hours, space and services would have been a good solution.</p>
        <p>''We see that there's money for things like the new stadium,'' she said, referring to the new billion-dollar Yankee Stadium under construction nearby. ''But there's not much money for people in the community.''</p>
