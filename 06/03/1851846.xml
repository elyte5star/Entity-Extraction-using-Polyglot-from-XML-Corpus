        <p>As a senior corps member with the New York City Ballet, 22-year-old Georgina Pazcoguin spends most of each day rehearsing in a leotard, tights and leg warmers, then stepping right into costume for performances at night. That leaves a scant few hours to flaunt her own style, so she tries to make every minute count.</p>
        <p>''I usually go out to dinner with friends after the show, so I wear outfits that I can layer,'' said Ms. Pazcoguin, who has been with the company five years. ''With a few really simple changes, I can be casual in the morning and more dressed at night.''</p>

        <p>As a senior corps member with the New York City Ballet, 22-year-old Georgina Pazcoguin spends most of each day rehearsing in a leotard, tights and leg warmers, then stepping right into costume for performances at night. That leaves a scant few hours to flaunt her own style, so she tries to make every minute count.</p>
        <p>''I usually go out to dinner with friends after the show, so I wear outfits that I can layer,'' said Ms. Pazcoguin, who has been with the company five years. ''With a few really simple changes, I can be casual in the morning and more dressed at night.''</p>
        <p>Here, she wears a Nanette Lepore dress over a black American Apparel T-shirt. She bought her Mercedes Salazar gold-skull pendant years before pirate chic exploded.</p>
        <p>''It's my punk phase lingering with me,'' she said. ''That was when I was 17 and 18.''</p>
        <p>The outfit is typically versatile: Post-performance, she wears the dress without the black T-shirt and trades flat shoes for heels.</p>
        <p>Heels, paired with short skirts, are a signature accessory for Ms. Pazcoguin.</p>
        <p>''I'm relatively short for a dancer -- 5-foot-5 -- so the opportunity to wear heels and be at eye level with some of the taller ballerinas is important to me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Not to mention that it highlights her hard-earned dancers' legs.</p>
        <p>''If you've got it, flaunt it, right?'' she said. ''High heels just make me happy. But don't tell my physical therapist.''</p>
