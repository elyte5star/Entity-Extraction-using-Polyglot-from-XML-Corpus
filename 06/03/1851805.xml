        <p>IT was a big deal in more ways than one in 1996 when the fledgling cable news network MSNBC and the State of New Jersey went into business together.</p>
        <p>First there was the money. MSNBC would get to keep most of what it withheld from its employees for state income tax, instead of it ending up in Trenton. And, the state would sell upwards of $160 million in bonds to pay for equipment MSNBC would need for its new studio in Secaucus.</p>
        <p>And there were jobs: more than 400 employees doing their bit for New Jersey's economy. Prestige mattered too: New Jersey, not New York, would be home to one of the most innovative expansions in broadcast history.</p>
        <p>This was one of the first tax breaks given under the state's Business Employment Incentive Program, and Gov. Christie Whitman was ebullient. ''This is a way to encourage high-income jobs to locate in New Jersey,'' she proclaimed during a press conference to mark the deal. MSNBC agreed to stay at least 15 years -- but 10 years and nearly $8 million in business incentive grants later, MSNBC has left the Garden State.</p>
        <p>Citing corporate restructuring and commercial pressures, MSNBC announced last fall it would move its Secaucus operations to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>It's getting to be an old story across the nation, states competing to offer lucrative subsidies to companies, announcing their arrival with great fanfare, and then left holding the bag when deals are broken. Companies have grown adept at stimulating bidding wars among states, cities and counties anxious to show job creation victories in what often is a zero-sum game for the region at large. As a business subsidy expert, Greg LeRoy, put it in his recent book, ''The Great American Jobs Scam,'' this is ''an intentionally constructed system that enables corporations to exact huge taxpayer subsidies by promising quality jobs -- and then lets them fail to deliver.''</p>
        <p>The MSNBC deal is just the latest example of questionable subsidy policy.</p>
        <p>In 2005, New Jersey agreed to give Verizon upwards of $80 million in tax breaks, even though the jobs coming to New Jersey left the company's total employment in the state lower than it had been before previous layoffs and transfers.</p>
        <p>Last year, the state awarded Citigroup $37.1 million for moving 1,200 workers about a mile -- from Manhattan to Jersey City. Presumably New Jersey didn't ask why the company needed this help if it could afford to pay $20 million a year for naming rights to the new baseball stadium being built for the Mets in Queens.</p>
        <p>Then there was AAA Mid-Atlantic, which moved employees starting in 2004 among New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland while creating no jobs and netting $8.1 million in tax breaks from Delaware and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The losers in this game are the taxpayers. With MSNBC, the state determined the cable network owed $2.3 million for leaving early, but it eased the sting considerably by declaring no money need actually change hands. Instead, the sum simply is to be deducted from a grant that sister company CNBC might receive someday for operations in Englewood Cliffs.</p>
        <p>But matters don't end there; New Jersey taxpayers' loss will be New York City taxpayers' loss too. In mid-March, the New York City Industrial Development Authority agreed to MSNBC's request for $1.5 million in property tax breaks in return for shifting 400-plus jobs from Secaucus to 30 Rockefeller Plaza -- the same jobs New Jersey had subsidized for 10 years.</p>
        <p>You'd think by now government officials would realize they are being played. Someone needs to be bold enough to make the first move, and unilaterally disarm in this unproductive war. Instead, subsidies and other business-location tax breaks get little public debate and scrutiny compared to other large government expenditures, and they are defended with unsupported assertions about economic growth while one state's work force grows at the expense of another's.</p>
        <p>The better way to build an economy is the old-fashioned way: investing in roads, mass transit, schools, worker training, a clean environment and other aspects of the public good that will be there to pay dividends long after fickle companies split for the next great deal.</p>
