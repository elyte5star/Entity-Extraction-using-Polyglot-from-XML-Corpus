        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I take issue with a statement in Corey S. Powell's review of ''Einstein: His Life and Universe,'' by Walter Isaacson, and ''Einstein: A Biography,'' by JÃ1/4rgen Neffe (May 20). The most precious thing Einstein's example offers ''the rest of us'' -- us ordinary folk -- is assuredly not a ''taste'' of a ''cosmic religious sense'' or ''connectedness to universal truth''; it is, rather, a glimpse of the awesome beauty and wonder of a mind driven by intense curiosity, and an inspiration to protect and nurture the fragile gift of curiosity that is native to young minds. Einstein's genuine cosmic religious sense -- in sharp contrast to the counterfeits peddled by established religion and two-bit gurus alike -- grew directly from his passionate pursuit of the deepest possible understanding of the universe, and is wholly unimaginable without it.</p>
