      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial supports City Council Speaker Christine Quinn's proposal to reform pay-to-play aspect of campaign financing system; holds any serious reform should end bundling of contributions, shut off flow of public money to incumbents who face no real competition and hold self-funded candidates and those who opt out to strict spending accountability</p>

        <p>The City Council is poised to address some of the worst abuses of New York's otherwise progressive campaign financing system. If the legislation now being shepherded by Speaker Christine Quinn curbs the influence of powerful interests, it could set a new standard for clean local government. That's an exciting prospect: It is conservatively estimated that in 2005 more than one-fifth of campaign donations came from special interests like city contractors and lobbyists.</p>
        <p>Reforming pay-to-play, as such influence buying is called, has long been a tantalizing goal. Until recently, though, databases to track those doing business with the city seemed out of reach. Improved technology has changed that, and now the biggest potential obstacle to reform is the City Council itself.</p>

        <p>The City Council is poised to address some of the worst abuses of New York's otherwise progressive campaign financing system. If the legislation now being shepherded by Speaker Christine Quinn curbs the influence of powerful interests, it could set a new standard for clean local government. That's an exciting prospect: It is conservatively estimated that in 2005 more than one-fifth of campaign donations came from special interests like city contractors and lobbyists.</p>
        <p>Reforming pay-to-play, as such influence buying is called, has long been a tantalizing goal. Until recently, though, databases to track those doing business with the city seemed out of reach. Improved technology has changed that, and now the biggest potential obstacle to reform is the City Council itself.</p>
        <p>A majority of the Council's 51 members is needed to approve any new law, and many members seem to think that reform would hurt fundraising. In fact, reform would help protect the public financing system, under which council candidates can receive four times the amount of qualifying dollars they raise privately. Many council members would not be in office were it not for these funds.</p>
        <p>However, the current system has flaws that erode public trust and need to be fixed. In addition to controlling pay-for-play, any serious reform should end the bundling of contributions, shut off the spigot that sends public money flowing to incumbents who face no real competition and hold self-funded candidates and those who opt out to strict spending accountability.</p>
        <p>Right now, council members can accept up to $2,750 from city contractors; that figure could be capped at $250 or so, and applied to lobbyists and officers of companies and other influential individuals who seek $100,000 or more worth of business with the city. Given the power of the real estate industry in New York, it would also make sense to apply the new ceilings to anyone with land use issues before the council.</p>
        <p>Proportionally higher caps should be set for contributions to candidates for higher city offices, which now rise to a hefty $4,950 per donor.</p>
        <p>Since none of the capped donations under the new rules would be eligible for matching funds, it might help to get council members on board if the rules were coupled with bigger incentives for smaller amounts raised from everyday New Yorkers, perhaps by increasing the matching ratio.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn has taken on a lot by trying to reform campaign finance while dealing with the city budget due by month's end. If she succeeds, reforms could be in place by the 2009 election, and that is a worthy goal.</p>
