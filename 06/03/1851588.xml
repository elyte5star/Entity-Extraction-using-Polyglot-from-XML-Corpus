        <p>After completing his 67-day, 3,278-mile swim down the Amazon River on April 8, Martin Strel, a 53-year-old Slovene, did not make the same mistake he made after finishing his 2,360-mile swim down the Mississippi in 2002 -- this time, instead of going home to Trebnje, he came to Hollywood. ''Jay Leno called us 37 times,'' says Strel's son, Borut, who manages his swimming expeditions, ''but we had appointments in Slovenia.''</p>
        <p>But not today. Fifteen days after climbing out of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, where he was promptly loaded into an ambulance for a ride to a local hospital (''with blood pressure at near heart attack levels,'' his official Web site reported), Strel and Borut are in Los Angeles, sipping red wine with a documentary filmmaker at a yellow-walled Italian restaurant in Marina del Rey. The filmmaker and his crew were with Strel for every stroke of his journey from Atalaya, Peru, to the Amazon's mouth, shooting a documentary, ''Big River Man,'' which is now being edited. Strel and Borut are in California to help with the editing, to brush up Strel's English in preparation for the film's publicity tour (and, they hope, a string of speaking engagements) and to field calls from the news media. ''I tell him, 'Why suffer again?' '' Borut explains. '' 'Why should we swim another river now? We should do show business. This is much more comfortable.' ''</p>

        <p>After completing his 67-day, 3,278-mile swim down the Amazon River on April 8, Martin Strel, a 53-year-old Slovene, did not make the same mistake he made after finishing his 2,360-mile swim down the Mississippi in 2002 -- this time, instead of going home to Trebnje, he came to Hollywood. ''Jay Leno called us 37 times,'' says Strel's son, Borut, who manages his swimming expeditions, ''but we had appointments in Slovenia.''</p>
        <p>But not today. Fifteen days after climbing out of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, where he was promptly loaded into an ambulance for a ride to a local hospital (''with blood pressure at near heart attack levels,'' his official Web site reported), Strel and Borut are in Los Angeles, sipping red wine with a documentary filmmaker at a yellow-walled Italian restaurant in Marina del Rey. The filmmaker and his crew were with Strel for every stroke of his journey from Atalaya, Peru, to the Amazon's mouth, shooting a documentary, ''Big River Man,'' which is now being edited. Strel and Borut are in California to help with the editing, to brush up Strel's English in preparation for the film's publicity tour (and, they hope, a string of speaking engagements) and to field calls from the news media. ''I tell him, 'Why suffer again?' '' Borut explains. '' 'Why should we swim another river now? We should do show business. This is much more comfortable.' ''</p>
        <p>No kidding. Strel averaged 50 miles a day -- about 10 hours of swimming -- on his journey down the Amazon. He wore a wet suit to protect himself against snakes, spiders, mosquitoes, poisonous insects, microbes and the candiru, a small parasitic fish known to swim up the opening of the penis and then lodge itself in the urethra with a spike. The sun was so strong that Strel suffered second-degree burns on the exposed skin of his face. His crew finally shrouded him in a pillowcase with holes cut for his eyes and his mouth, a ''Halloween''-esque get-up that evoked a local legend about a white demon called pishtaco and sent Peruvian villagers fleeing and screaming when Strel landed onshore. During much of the swim, Strel and his support team were afflicted with diarrhea, which Strel had to relieve inside his wet suit or risk exposing himself to the above-mentioned snakes, spiders, etc. There were also crocodiles, whirlpools, waves, tides, drug smugglers and pirates to overcome or evade. And predatory women. ''Women in Brazil are very dangerous,'' Strel explains. ''You have many places in the jungle where is 20 times more women than men.'' When he emerged from the river in some of those places, women would literally grab him and try to drag him away. ''They want to go with you,'' Borut says. ''They never stop. That's why we say they're like piranhas.''</p>
        <p>Oh yes, piranhas. Strel smeared his body with lanolin and Vaseline to seal cuts and scratches, and his support vessel carried buckets of pig and chicken blood to dump in the river to lure away the carnivorous fish. (To be effective, the blood had to be old and smelly, so smelly that the crew eventually stopped keeping it in stock.) Strel nevertheless felt himself being nibbled one morning downriver from Manaus. ''He started screaming,'' Borut says. ''Then we took him out.''</p>
        <p>''Here,'' Strel says, pulling down a sock to display abrasions above his right ankle. ''Piranha.''</p>
        <p>So . . . uh . . . why?</p>
        <p>''For me it was about achieving the impossible,'' says Strel, who used to be a guitar teacher. ''Like Hillary, to reach top of Everest.''</p>
        <p>The official motto of all his swims has been ''Swim for peace, friendship and clean waters.''</p>
        <p>He also dedicated his Amazon swim to preserving the rain forest.</p>
        <p>Also, according to one of his blogs, ''If I can swim that river, then the Palestinians and the Israelis can find a way to live together in peace,'' and ''the Chinese government can allow the sovereign of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, to return to his throne'' and ''the 8 most powerful and richest countries in the world can find a way to forgive the debts of the 15 poorest countries.'' And a bunch of other stuff too. ''For all these reasons,'' Strel's declaration says, ''I am going to swim that river.''</p>
        <p>But here's another clue from his Web site: ''As a young boy, I was beaten a lot by my parents and schoolmasters. This no doubt contributed greatly to my ability to ignore pain and endure.''</p>
        <p>Is there a psychiatrist on the river? (Actually, there was. Strel sat down for an hour of psychotherapy on some nights. Among the topics discussed were the hallucinations he experienced on a regular basis, causing him to babble to himself as he swam.)</p>
        <p>My personal opinion is that he does it because he can.</p>
        <p>Strel is a powerfully built man, 5-foot-9 and 253 pounds when he started his Amazon swim (217 when he finished). His chest is broad, his legs strong, his short graying hair combed neatly forward toward a nose that starts out thin and straight and then takes a dive toward the equator, the result of being broken three times (''The first time was fighting, then gymnastics, then fighting with policemen,'' he says). An all-around athlete, Strel was attracted early on to swimming and went professional in 1978. He doesn't like pools -- ''To swim 50 seconds for 100 meters, that's not me'' -- so he tried his hand at the World Cup open-water circuit, but those were ocean swims and he doesn't like salt, either. ''It destroy my mouth,'' he says. ''You can't drink, you can't eat. No wine. Beer, a little, maybe. Water. Soup, no.''</p>
        <p>So he thought things over: ''In my head, What to do? I can swim more, longer.'' The solution was obvious: fresh water. ''In the lake, in the river, I can reach -- '' His son finishes his thought: '' -- what his power allows him to do.'' After a little warming up (65 miles in the River Krka in Slovenia), he ultimately decided to do something special for the millennium: in 2000 he swam the length of the Danube, 1,866 miles through 10 countries, a new world record in distance swimming. The next year he swam in the Danube again, this time a mere 313 miles -- but he did it without stopping (in 84 hours), a different world record. He swam the Mississippi in 2002, the ParanÃ¡ in South America in 2003, the Yangtze in 2004. The Yangtze swim was 2,487 miles, which became the new world record. The Amazon swim topped it by almost 800 miles.</p>
        <p>''We try to promote him as an ordinary man,'' says Borut, a boyish 26-year-old who is on indefinite leave from computer science studies at the University of Ljubljana while he manages his father's ventures. ''He eats lunch with the crew -- not special athlete stuff -- and he drinks a lot. But he swims down the Amazon.''</p>
        <p>It was the drinking that brought the Strels together with John Maringouin, the producer and director of ''Big River Man,'' who is dining with them in Marina del Rey this afternoon. ''I first saw him on CNN while he was swimming the Mississippi,'' Maringouin recalls. ''He was drinking a bottle of wine on the riverbank. That's what was amazing.'' He turns to Strel in the restaurant: ''That's what's special about you.'' Strel nods. ''Wine, by me,'' he says, ''one bottle a day must be. If it keeps you a little drunk, that's good.''</p>
        <p>While swimming, he means. While doing the thing that makes him a world-class athlete. ''You have to be a little drunk.'' Keeps his mind off what might be underneath him in the water, he says. Which does help explain it.</p>
        <p>Strel has a modest, pleasant air about him, but he does enjoy the perks of celebrity. ''He's the most famous man in Slovenia,'' Maringouin says. Borut adds, ''He can park anywhere he wants.'' His picture appears on the label of a popular Slovene wine. I wonder if he gets paid for that. ''No,'' Borut says. ''In our country, they just give him wine.''</p>
        <p>Which reminds Maringouin of a trip to Slovenia to visit Strel before the Amazon swim. ''Borut told me, 'Martin's got a really important conference. He's going to speak in Austria. It's an environmental conference.' I said, 'Great, this will be great for the film. Let's go film it.' We drive three hours to Austria, and Borut says, 'Actually, it's environmental but kind of home environment. It's for vacuum cleaners. It's a vacuum-cleaner convention. But Martin is the guest of honor. And it's really important. These are guys with money, and we need to raise as much money as we can.' So Martin does his little speech at the vacuum-cleaner sales rally, and they do a fireworks show for him, and I say, 'What are they giving you to do this?' And Borut says, 'Well, they're giving us a free vacuum cleaner.' And the next day Borut is standing in his room looking at this vacuum cleaner, and I say, 'What are you doing?' And he says, 'Martin's on the phone right now trying to sell it.' ''</p>
        <p>Which pretty much explains why he is sitting in Los Angeles today instead of in Slovenia. ''Movie,'' Strel says, ''can get us a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>That remains to be seen, but Strel certainly gave the filming everything he had. During the Amazon swim, when Maringouin asked him to take off his wet suit (''I didn't just want to see a visual of a man in a wet suit in the Amazon,'' Maringouin explains. ''I wanted to see a man swimming down the Amazon''), Strel did it. When Maringouin asked him to swim in a channel that was very scenic but dangerously close to shore and wildlife, Strel did it. When Maringouin asked him to hold a camera and film himself as he flipped backward out of his chase boat into the river, Strel was afraid the camera would whack him on the head. Did he do it? Strel smiles and says, ''Ten times.''</p>
        <p>Occasionally, however, he would draw a line. ''He would do things like that,'' says Maringouin, ''and then say, 'Dude, I still have to swim the Amazon.' '' And back in the main channel he would go, 10 hours and 30,000 strokes a day (nearly two million strokes in all), never a day off, for more than two months, swimming for peace in the Middle East, for the Dalai Lama, for clean water, for the rain forest. . . .</p>
        <p>Around five o'clock each day, Strel says, he would slow down and look around, and someone in his chase boat would say, ''Martin, one day more.'' Strel shakes his head. ''It's not so simple to reach so many miles a day,'' he says. ''Fifty miles, 60 miles, sometimes more. Today is finished, you are very tired. It is difficult to do next day again . . . again . . . again . . . again.''</p>
        <p>But he did it. And only a little bit drunk. .</p>
