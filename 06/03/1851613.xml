        <p>DIFFERENT LIKE COCO</p>
        <p>Written and illustrated</p>
        <p>by Elizabeth Matthews.</p>
        <p>Unpaged. Candlewick Press. $16.99.</p>
        <p>(Ages 5 to 9)</p>
        <p>Nearly a century after Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel opened her first shop on the exclusive Rue Cambon in Paris, the name Chanel remains synonymous with fashion.</p>
        <p>The revolutionary designer had a rich and dramatic life, and even the necessarily simplified version Elizabeth Matthews offers in her likable first book is lively and inspiring. Embrace what makes you different, Matthews suggests, and you will find success.</p>
        <p>Born illegitimate in 1883 in a provincial French town, Gabrielle Chanel grew up very poor, with five siblings. Though her parents married when she was a baby, her mother died young, and Coco and her sisters were sent to an orphanage. Her restless and resourceful nature, combined with an insatiable taste for whatever bits of luxury she encountered, drove her to become a hard-working diva of fashion and society. In her pursuit of fame and wealth Chanel inspired -- and exuded -- passion, extravagance, jealousy and outrage. She became an icon of her time but, in spite of her celebrity and affluence, never found lasting love, never had a family and died embittered and alone.</p>
        <p>Matthews presents Chanel's austere childhood with mixed success. One particularly evocative illustration depicts the bleak landscape of the orphanage, punctuated by the thick blackness of the nun's habits. But other pictures are incongruously jaunty. In later pages Matthews captures the daring new look of Chanel's designs -- the sleek silhouette achieved by the open cardigan, the long pearls, the close-fitting hat -- and its striking contrast to the lavishness of the gowns and millinery then in vogue. Often, however, her cartoonish pen-and-ink drawings and breezy text belie both the severity of Chanel's early years and the fierceness of her later ones.</p>
        <p>Also troubling are the occasional anachronisms, like the charming but decidedly contemporary opening picture of skinny little Gabrielle holding a roll of toilet paper (in 19th-century France?) with which she is stuffing her slip in an effort to create a rounded bosom. Other details beg explanation, or could have used further comment. Most adult readers will be able to explain who Picasso was, but many will draw a blank on Paul Poiret, the avant-garde designer who said about his competitor's style: ''Until now, women were beautiful and architectural. ... Now they resemble undernourished telephone operators.''</p>
        <p>While appealing, ''Different Like Coco'' is misleading in its lighthearted portrayal of a figure who was every bit as sharp, arrogant and lonely as she was defiant and glamorous. More important, Matthews does not fully convey the significance of Coco's achievements (though a closing timeline helps). Chanel's legacy is not that she was ''always different'' -- and definitely not that everyone loved her, as the closing lines proclaim -- but that the clothing she created played a pivotal role in the changing identity of women.</p>
