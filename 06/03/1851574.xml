        <p>HEAD METALLIX 6  The space-age Head combines a strong, lightweight, crystalline metal alloy with a stabilizer that uses earthquake-resistance technology: it shakes in the opposite direction of the vibrations, diminishing the tremors that can cause tennis elbow. $250. head.com.</p>
        <p>VOLKL DNX 1 POWER ARM  Nanotechnology refers to building with materials measured at a billionth of a meter, and Volkl uses it in the Power Arm. Reinforced with graphite nanotubes (lighter than carbon and 25 times as strong), the racket resists flexing. $269. volkl.com.</p>
        <p>WILSON [K] SIX.ONE TOUR  Roger Federer's new racket also features nanotechnology; Wilson bonded microscopic silicon-dioxide molecules with carbon-black nanofibers in the frame, thereby increasing the player's control. $220. wilson.com.</p>
        <p>PRINCE O3 SPEEDPORT BLUE  Prince's oversize rackets introduced oversize sweet spots -- but also unwieldy size. The 03 has rectangular ''Speedports'' that allow the strings to flex more freely, providing a massive sweet spot with no added head size. $269. princetennis.com.</p>
