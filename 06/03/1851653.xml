        <p>Forget luxury tents and designer pods. The newest trend in alternative hotel accommodation is a combination of the two -- a compact, minimally decorated space set in the great outdoors.</p>
        <p>Take the ''sleep pipe,'' at far right. In a park next to the Danube River in Ottensheim, Austria, an art school graduate named Andreas Strauss has created a cozy accommodation just large enough for a double bed, a storage shelf and a lamp. Open from May through October, each of the three existing sleep pipes has a window, electricity and is near public toilets, showers and a cafe. Visitors book online at www.dasparkhotel.net and are given a code that opens the door. Guests are asked to pay what they can.</p>

        <p>Forget luxury tents and designer pods. The newest trend in alternative hotel accommodation is a combination of the two -- a compact, minimally decorated space set in the great outdoors.</p>
        <p>Take the ''sleep pipe,'' at far right. In a park next to the Danube River in Ottensheim, Austria, an art school graduate named Andreas Strauss has created a cozy accommodation just large enough for a double bed, a storage shelf and a lamp. Open from May through October, each of the three existing sleep pipes has a window, electricity and is near public toilets, showers and a cafe. Visitors book online at www.dasparkhotel.net and are given a code that opens the door. Guests are asked to pay what they can.</p>
        <p>Already there are plans to create more sleep pipes elsewhere in Austria.</p>
        <p>On Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Tom Chudleigh has built two wooden spheres, above, that allow visitors to literally hang out for the night in a forest at Qualicum Bay. Each insulated sphere has electricity and dangles by three ropes tethered to three separate trees. The more minimalist ''Eve'' (yes, they are named), which rents for $100 a night, or two nights for $175, has a double bed and storage, as well as a settee and a table, while the more deluxe ''Eryn'' has a double bed, a loft bed, a cupboard, a sink, a microwave and a refrigerator. Eryn is $150 a night or $275 for two nights ($35 extra for a third person). More information is as www.freespiritspheres.com.</p>
        <p>Bothy Lodge is making 25- and 50-square meter (270 and 538 square feet) wooden cottages equipped with televisions, power showers and audio systems to be placed on the grounds of British country hotels (www.bothylodge.com)..  At least 50 hotels in Britain plan to install them in the next year. One at the Enterkine Country House in Ayrshire is available for Â£195 a night, about $390 at $2.01 to the pound.</p>
