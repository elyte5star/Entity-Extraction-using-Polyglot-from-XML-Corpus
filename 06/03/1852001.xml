        <p>A militant group in Nigeria's oil-producing Niger Delta said Saturday that it would temporarily cease its campaign of pipeline attacks, bombings and kidnappings to allow for a negotiated settlement of its grievances with the newly elected government.</p>
        <p>The announcement by the group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, was made a day after four foreign oil workers were kidnapped from the office of an oil services firm in Port Harcourt, the center of the country's oil industry, in a brazen attack by men dressed in police uniforms.</p>
        <p>The kidnapped men, who were abducted Friday evening, were Dutch, Pakistani, British and French, according to their employer, Schlumberger, the international oilfield services company.</p>
        <p>Violence has increased in the delta in the past year as Nigeria hurtled toward its first transition from one elected government to another. The delta's mangrove-lined waterways and plains produce much of Nigeria's wealth, but the region remains one of the country's poorest and least developed. Dozens of foreign workers have been kidnapped, oil pipelines and flow stations have been blown up and offices of oil companies have been robbed, sometimes in broad daylight.</p>
        <p>The group's announcement, made in an e-mail message to news organizations by a man calling himself Jomo Gbomo, said it had freed its six remaining hostages, who include one American, and was willing to negotiate with the government.</p>
        <p>''We will suspend attacks on oil installations for one month,'' he wrote, ''a period which we hope the government will take advantage of to ruminate on positive and realistic measures towards a just peace in the delta. Following this period, we will resume attacks on installations and oil workers in the delta with greater purpose.''</p>
        <p>Umaru Yar'Adua was sworn in as president last week after an election marred by widespread fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yar'Adua, a little-known northern governor with a reputation for honesty, has said he plans to work for a peaceful settlement and has put development in the delta, where insurgencies have raged for decades, at the top of his domestic agenda.</p>
