        <p>We always suspected a lot of '60s musicians were in it for the money. But even 40 years later it's like a punch in the gut to read Michelle Phillips's words. After saying that the San Francisco groups thought they were ''the real heart and soul'' (in contrast to Los Angeles groups like hers), she adds: ''I think they were just jealous because we were making the money. The whole point, I thought, was to make hit records.''</p>

        <p>Lalalalala. Don't wanna hear that. I'm gonna keep putting the Stones and Dylan on my stereo (see how old I am? I said stereo, not iPod), and I'm going to keep cranking them up real loud, and I'm even going to play their recent stuff. Which I buy! On CDs! I really want to believe they did it to win my heart and move my soul, because they did.</p>
