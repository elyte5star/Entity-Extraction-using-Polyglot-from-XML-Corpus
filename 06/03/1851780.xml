        <p>CAMERAS flashed and cars slowed down. It's not every day you see Robert De Niro getting his toenails clipped in Stamford.</p>
        <p>But there he was one May evening, inside You Got Nails, a salon on Bedford Street, with his pants rolled up. At least that is where he was for the film, ''What Just Happened?'' directed by Barry Levinson, which also stars Sean Penn, Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci.</p>
        <p>You Got Nails, with a new sign -- it is called Eternal Spring Spa in the movie -- was ready for its close-up. Hundreds of people lined the street, straining to catch a glimpse of Mr. De Niro as he emerged from the shop for his next scene. ''Clear the way, guys,'' a production assistant begged. ''Turn your flashes off!''</p>
        <p>The crowds pressed forward as Mr. De Niro came out with his pants rolled up. He looked around and went back in. Cut.</p>
        <p>''Oh, my God, he's hot,'' said Yeag Jang, a 30-year-old woman from Stamford.</p>
        <p>Moviegoers will have to wait till next year to find out what happens next. But we do know that the film is set in Hollywood and is about the tribulations of a film producer, played by Mr. De Niro. Most of the exteriors were shot in Los Angeles. But in April, the production moved to Connecticut to film interiors in places like Stamford, Bridgeport, Shelton, Ridgefield and Greenwich. What would make the producers schlep across the country? Was it because the director, Barry Levinson, 65, lives in Redding?</p>
        <p>No, said Heidi Hamilton, director of the Film Division of the State Commission on Culture and Tourism. ''It has everything to do with the tax credit,'' she said, which took effect last July and allows producers who spend in excess of $50,000 in the state to receive up to 30 percent tax credits.</p>
        <p>''Basically you get a discount on everything, even actors' salaries,'' said Mike Upton, senior vice president for 2929 Productions, which is producing ''What Just Happened?'' with Mr. De Niro's company, TriBeCa Productions, and Art Linson Productions. (Mr. Linson wrote the memoir on which the movie is based.)</p>
        <p>''It's definitely cheaper to shoot in Connecticut,'' even with the extra traveling and living expenses, said Mr. Upton, whose company also produced ''In Bloom,'' starring Uma Thurman, which was filmed entirely in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levinson, the Oscar-winning director and Redding resident, said he saw the film as ''a human comedy of desperation -- of survival in this business -- so intense that it is humorous.''</p>
        <p>Which is how the O and G Industries asphalt plant in Stamford came to have its brush with stardom. In ''What Just Happened?'' there is a movie within a movie: Sean Penn plays Sean Penn acting in a gangster film. There is a chase scene. He scrambles over the gritty hills of O and G and there are gunshots.</p>
        <p>''We did the body hits,'' said Phil Gauvin, licensed pyrotechnician and president of Pyro-FX Entertainment Group in Hamden.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levinson said, ''Mostly, we are using Connecticut the way we use a sound stage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levinson, who has directed films like ''Man of the Year'' (2006), ''Wag the Dog'' (1997), ''Bugsy'' (1991), ''Diner'' (1982) and ''Rain Man'' (1988), for which he received the best director Oscar, mentioned the economic benefits of filming in Connecticut, as well as the ability to go home at night: ''Everybody has been very accommodating.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I also love the idea of making a movie about Hollywood in Connecticut.''</p>
