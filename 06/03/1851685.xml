        <p>Several museum shows are opening this week, offering viewers everything from monumental sculptures to early American rugs.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most anticipated of them is the RICHARD SERRA retrospective that begins Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. Spanning 40 years of his career and filling the museum as well as its sculpture garden, the show features some of his early experiments with materials like rubber and neon as well as the giant, labyrinthlike steel sculptures that have become his signature. Among the best known of the large works is ''Intersection II,'' a 60-ton sculpture made of four two-inch-thick gentle curves of hot rolled steel, and ''Torqued Ellipse IV,'' a 46-ton sculpture that is a twisted ribbon in the shape of an ellipse standing on its edge. Both are from the Modern's own collection. The show will also feature three new works. Through Sept. 10, moma.org.</p>
        <p>Next door, opening on Tuesday at the Folk Art Museum, is ''The Great Cover-Up: American Rugs on Beds, Tables and Floors,'' a show devoted to early American rugs. On view will be about 65 rugs dating from the end of the 18th century through the mid-20th century. Through Sept. 9, 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, folkartmuseum.org.</p>
        <p>A peek at one of the greatest libraries of Renaissance Italy will be the subject of ''FEDERICO DA MONTEFELTRO AND HIS LIBRARY,'' an exhibition opening Thursday at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum. Montefeltro, or the Duke of Urbino, was, fittingly, a true Renaissance man, fascinated with everything from theology to poetry. In addition to portraits and illuminated manuscripts, the exhibition will include the duke's horoscope of 1475 (on loan from the Beinecke Library at Yale University), which shows his interest in astrology, and a coded letter of 1478 that documents his secret military involvement in an attempted coup against the Medici in Florence. The duke's library will be recreated in the 20-square-foot, cube-shaped gallery that the Italian architect Renzo Piano designed after Renaissance chambers. Through Sept. 30, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, morganlibrary.org.</p>
