        <p>As the second act opened of ''Voyage,'' the beginning of Tom Stoppard's trilogy, ''The Coast of Utopia,'' the season's most visually sublime moment came into full view. We were in Moscow now, in March of 1834, having left the idyll of Premukhino, the Bakunin family estate, a place of long meals, pastoral languor.</p>
        <p>'' 'For happiness, apparently, something of the real world is necessary,' '' Ivan Turgenev had told us in the previous scene, quoting another character. And now indeed we were in the world, in a city full of bustle and fervor.</p>
        <p>In the Lincoln Center Theater production the set designers Bob Crowley and Scott Pask introduced us to Moscow as a place of communitarian pleasures. What appeared to be a skating rink emerged on the stage, with the image of the castlelike St. Basil's Cathedral hanging above it, a glistening structure seemingly made of icicles so well proportioned and beautifully formed that it produced gasps among audience members in the performance I saw.</p>
        <p>The scene of opulent serenity was all the more poignant for what it obscured. ''Young men and women are pairing off like swans on the skating ground,'' the writer and activist Alexander Herzen observed to friends. ''A crocodile of Polish prisoners goes clanking by in leg-irons on the Vladimir Road.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 3, 2007, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article today on Page 12 of the special Tony Awards section of Arts &amp; Leisure about indelible moments on Broadway omits, in some copies, several words in the first two paragraphs of an item on ''The Coast of Utopia.'' The passage should read:</p>
