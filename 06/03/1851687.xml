        <p>GELSEY KIRKLAND's celebrated and troubled career began at the New York City Ballet and continued at American Ballet Theater, where she formed a celebrated partnership with Mikhail Baryshnikov. Her last role, in 1987, was Aurora in ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which she danced to immense acclaim with the Royal Ballet in London. This week Ms. Kirkland, one of the leading ballerinas of her generation, is returning to the stage with AMERICAN BALLET THEATER in the same ballet. This time she will play the wicked fairy Carabosse, whose revengeful fury propels the narrative. Ms. Kirkland, who also staged this production along with Kevin McKenzie and Michael Chernov, was famous for her meticulous, often obsessive approach to preparing her roles. Here is another chance to watch a great artist work her magic. Monday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 2 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110.</p>
        <p>A new work by CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON is always an occasion unto itself, but his ''Nightingale and the Rose,'' for the New York City Ballet, where he is the resident choreographer, will also be the premiere of the first commissioned score from Bright Sheng, the company's resident composer. The ballet, based on Oscar Wilde's poignant story, features the wonderful Wendy Whelan alongside Sara Mearns and Tyler Angle, two of the company's most promising juniors. There's never any guarantee that two luminous talents like Mr. Wheeldon and Mr. Sheng will burn brighter together, but the possibility is a compelling one. Friday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycb.org; $15 to $82.</p>
        <p>Not content with being a ballet legend, having his own arts center, and commissioning and dancing in contemporary work for his touring groups (to say nothing of acting and taking photographs), MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV has found time to write a children's book. Charmingly illustrated by Vladimir Radunsky, ''Because,'' which just arrived in bookstores, tells of an irrepressible Granny who loves to dance. Its message is to be unafraid to reveal your special talents to the world. Mr. Baryshnikov has set a good example. Simon &amp; Schuster, $16.99.</p>
