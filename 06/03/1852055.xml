        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Illegal Immigrants and Their Employers'' (letter, May 27) criticizes both workers who break the law by entering this country and those who break the law by hiring them. Such widespread violation often occurs when a law is unjust, unenforceable or so poorly conceived that the practical and human considerations come to outweigh the legislative ones.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Illegal Immigrants and Their Employers'' (letter, May 27) criticizes both workers who break the law by entering this country and those who break the law by hiring them. Such widespread violation often occurs when a law is unjust, unenforceable or so poorly conceived that the practical and human considerations come to outweigh the legislative ones.</p>
        <p>It's obvious that the law as it stands is useless and hypocritical. It deprives workers and employers of a way to legalize people whose desire is not to break the law, but to continue doing what we want and need them to.</p>
        <p>Laws that supported discrimination, disenfranchisement and prohibition were repealed because they were inherently immoral, or absurd. A law that deprives willing workers of the right to earn a living, when we as a society clearly need their services, falls into both categories.</p>
        <p>Intelligent reform of the immigration laws will resolve the issue. Without such reform, disobedience and hypocrisy are bound to continue.</p>
