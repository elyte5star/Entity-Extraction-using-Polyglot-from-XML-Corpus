        <p>Revelations about the existence of a 3-year-old boy named Emmanuel have shaken a country hardened by a seemingly interminable war.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>His name is Emmanuel.</p>
        <p>Details about his entrance into this world are sparse, but this much about him has been gleaned: he is 3 years old and lives in the jungle; his mother is Clara Rojas, a former aspirant to the vice presidency of this country; and his father is one of the guerrillas who have held Ms. Rojas in captivity for the last five years.</p>
        <p>Emmanuel's existence was first reported to an unsettled public last year. But revelations in recent weeks, including his name, obtained from an emaciated police officer who spent 17 days in the wilderness after escaping from a guerrilla encampment in southern Colombia, have shaken a country hardened by a seemingly interminable war in which kidnapping has been polished into an effective weapon.</p>
        <p>''Clara suffered so much,'' said Jhon Frank Pinchao, the policeman who fled from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest rebel group, after eight years in captivity, in an emotional news conference here in mid-May. ''I could hear her asking to see her son.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinchao, who said he once held Emmanuel in his arms, offered a few other details about the boy. He said the boy was healthy and was raised as ''an Indian boy is treated.'' Two men kidnapped by the FARC, with the surnames Buitrago and Moreno, stitched clothes for Emmanuel by hand, as did the guerrillas, Mr. Pinchao said.</p>
        <p>''They would take him to see her,'' the policeman said.</p>
        <p>''Then they would pick him up,'' he continued. ''The guerrillas were in charge of the child.''</p>
        <p>With those words, Mr. Pinchao turned the world of Ms. Rojas's family here upside down and sent some of his countrymen into bouts of soul-searching as they contemplated a nation in which babies were born in captivity. Questions as to what ties existed between Ms. Rojas and Emmanuel's father, whose identity is not public, are unanswered.</p>
        <p>''We do not know if rape was involved, but one certainty is that a woman in captivity is absolutely vulnerable,'' said Olga Lucía Gómez, director of the País Libre Foundation, which counsels kidnap victims.</p>
        <p>The FARC is known to prohibit physical intimacy between its combatants and captives. Mr. Pinchao said the child's father was rumored to have been removed from his post or killed.</p>
        <p>Though kidnapping rates have declined, abductions for economic and political purposes are still distressingly frequent. More than 3,100 people are still held in captivity in Colombia, according to the National Fund for the Defense of Personal Liberty. Ninety-two children were kidnapped in 2006, down from a high of 298 in 2002, according to País Libre.</p>
        <p>''If Emmanuel dies,'' Héctor Abad Faciolince, one of Colombia's most prominent novelists, wrote in an essay, the country is in deep trouble. ''If Emmanuel doesn't start school and doesn't grow healthy and strong, we will be the most savage country on earth, the dirtiest, the worst.''</p>
        <p>President Álvaro Uribe has asked Vice President Francisco Santos -- who was himself abducted by drug lords in 1990 in an episode later described in Gabriel García Márquez's ''News of a Kidnapping'' -- to lead an international campaign to pressure the FARC to release Emmanuel.</p>
        <p>The details about Emmanuel have also focused attention on Ms. Rojas, 44, an urbane lawyer who was kidnapped in 2002 together with Ingrid Betancourt, a presidential candidate and longtime friend, while driving into FARC territory.</p>
        <p>Officer Pinchao said that Ms. Rojas and Ms. Betancourt were alive. So, he said, were the three American military contractors, Marc Gonsalves, Tom Howes and Keith Stansell, who have been held by the guerrillas since 2003, when their surveillance plane went down in southern Colombia.</p>
        <p>This verbal proof of life has given hope to a plan by President Uribe to release about 250 jailed guerrillas in an attempt to a secure a similar gesture by the FARC. Besides Ms. Rojas, Ms. Betancourt and the three Americans, the rebel group holds more than 50 kidnapping victims that they have deemed exchangeable for other concessions.</p>
        <p>[Among the guerrillas set to be released by Mr. Uribe's government is a woman who is raising her 2-year-old in prison. ''It is a coincidence,'' Interior Minister Carlos Holguín said Friday. ''But it is a nice message for the FARC to give us Emmanuel.''</p>
        <p>[Senator Piedad Córdoba, an opposition lawmaker thought to be on good terms with the FARC, said Thursday that the liberation of Ms. Rojas, Emmanuel and Ms. Betancourt, a citizen of Colombia and France, was ''imminent'' because of pressure from the French government. But Mr. Holguín said Ms. Córdoba's statement was a ''figment of her imagination.'']</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Emmanuel's relatives, including his grandmother, Clara González de Rojas, are absorbing the news. In an interview at her apartment here, decorated with a large photograph of her daughter in a red suit, Ms. González de Rojas said friends had begun giving her presents, including stuffed animals and a silver spoon, for Emmanuel, her fifth grandchild.</p>
        <p>''I looked up Emmanuel's name in the Bible,'' said Ms. González de Rojas, 76. The name, she said, which she was assured had been chosen by her daughter, means ''God is with us.''</p>
        <p>''My daughter is very investigative, she read the Dalai Lama, the Koran, tomes about Jewish history,'' she said. ''I don't like melodrama, but I feel my daughter was sending us all a message by naming her son Emmanuel, a message to become sensitized.''</p>
        <p>An even more direct message may be found in the Catholic hymn that begins ''O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel.''</p>
        <p>Ms. González de Rojas first learned about Emmanuel a year ago, when Jorge Enrique Botero, a Colombian journalist who had interviewed FARC commanders, published a book called ''Latest News of a War'' about Emmanuel's birth.</p>
        <p>Some here doubted Mr. Botero's account because he acknowledged fictionalizing certain details.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Botero said he felt vindicated by Mr. Pinchao's information about Emmanuel. ''The story of this boy reflects the degradation of the conflict,'' said Mr. Botero. ''This is about people who are forgotten by our society.''</p>
