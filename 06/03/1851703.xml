        <p>Shed more than a decade in 90 minutes, without plastic surgery. This miraculous act of rejuvenation is achieved by Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill in ''Blackbird'' at the Manhattan Theater Club.

        <p>For in their finely graded portrayals of a middle-aged man and a young woman with a shared past, Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill make it clear that turning back the clock involves the kind of warping associated with timepieces by Salvador Dalí. Their characters, Ray and Una, were briefly but indelibly lovers when she was 12 and he was in his early 40s. And under the direction of Joe Mantello, who knows how to sustain tautness in unreeling a yarn, Ray and Una's reunion becomes a journey to a time 15 years before that neither has ever really left.</p>

        <p>Shed more than a decade in 90 minutes, without plastic surgery. This miraculous act of rejuvenation is achieved by Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill in ''Blackbird'' at the Manhattan Theater Club. Their mastery of the art of growing younger is a big factor in making David Harrower's drama the season's most compelling -- and devastating.</p>
        <p>For in their finely graded portrayals of a middle-aged man and a young woman with a shared past, Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill make it clear that turning back the clock involves the kind of warping associated with timepieces by Salvador Dalí. Their characters, Ray and Una, were briefly but indelibly lovers when she was 12 and he was in his early 40s. And under the direction of Joe Mantello, who knows how to sustain tautness in unreeling a yarn, Ray and Una's reunion becomes a journey to a time 15 years before that neither has ever really left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill begin the evening with a full battery of grown-up defenses and social mannerisms that they systematically scald off each other, as if pulling away layers of skin. There comes a moment when you look at Ms. Pill, alone in a spotlight, in shock, because she has turned unconditionally into a frightened, manipulative and overpoweringly passionate girl who is at most a very raw 12.</p>
        <p>It could be argued that all of us are frozen internally at some age or another. But it's rare to be allowed such a searingly physical vision of the child within someone else. Becoming younger may not be restorative for these characters or the performers playing them. (Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill look thoroughly depleted at their curtain call.) But the artistry that informs their transformations energizes anyone lucky enough to have watched them.</p>
