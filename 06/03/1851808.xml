        <p>School officials in the northern New Jersey suburb of Paramus abdicated their responsibility for assuring student safety by waiting more than four months before warning parents about contaminated soil just outside a middle school.</p>
        <p>The school was shut down indefinitely last week by the town's mayor, James Tedesco, following a storm of protests from justifiably outraged parents. The local Board of Education announced that classes would be held at nearby Bergen Community College through June.</p>
        <p>School officials learned about the contamination in January when an area next to the 47-year-old school was dug up for electrical work. Soil samples contained chlordane and two other pesticides up to 39 times the state's safety standards.</p>
        <p>But not until a local newspaper, The Record, in Hackensack, began asking questions last month did the school district inform parents or the public. State environmental officials are trying to determine whether the soil was properly fenced off and covered, as required by the state.</p>
        <p>A federal Environmental Protection Agency spokesman said that chlordane could cause liver problems if inhaled or swallowed, and that the two other pesticides, aldrin and dieldrin, could cause convulsions if swallowed.</p>
        <p>At a Paramus Council meeting last week, angry parents demanded to know why they were not informed as soon as the contamination was discovered. Several said their children have recently complained of headaches and coughing. Students said that some youngsters had been inside the fenced off area taking pictures.</p>
        <p>School Board President Mario Sicari acknowledges that the board made a mistake in not immediately notifying parents of the school's 700 students. He said the chlordane could have dated to the mid 1980s or before when it was used for termites. The other pesticides could have come from the days when Paramus, now known for shopping centers and congested highways, was a prime celery farming area.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, state DEP workers last week carted away truckloads of the tainted soil, something that should have been done long ago. The state attorney general's office should investigate to see whether school officials violated any state laws.</p>
        <p>State education and environmental officials should also take specific steps to make sure that this kind of lapse does not happen again, in Paramus or anyplace else.</p>
