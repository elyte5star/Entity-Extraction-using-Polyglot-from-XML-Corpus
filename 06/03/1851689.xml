        <p>DUMPSTAPHUNK is the best funk band from New Orleans right now. That's no small thing in a city where rhythm is a natural resource, an art, an advanced science, an incantation and an exorcism as well as a reason to dance.</p>
        <p>IVAN NEVILLE, the keyboardist who leads Dumpstaphunk, has a funk pedigree. His father is Aaron Neville of the Neville Brothers, which also includes Art Neville of the Meters, the definitive 1960s and 1970s New Orleans funk band. Ivan himself was a longtime member of the Neville Brothers, and like them he sees no reason not to mix messages with a dance beat. Dumpstaphunk follows through on the Meters' and Neville Brothers' snickering, sputtering, wah-wah New Orleans funk, and onstage it charges through songs from Sly Stone and Creedence Clearwater Revival.</p>
        <p>But Dumpstaphunk is no oldies act. It has new songs that push the New Orleans heritage into the post-Katrina era. ''Ugly Truth,'' ''Meanwhile'' and ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' -- all at myspace.com/dumpstaphunk -- are powered by rage and humor as well as rhythm, which doesn't make them any less danceable. Friday at 11 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $15 in advance, $17 Friday.</p>
        <p>Funk and hard-headed social consciousness also meet in the music of EL-P. He has been a prime mover in alternative hip-hop since the mid-1990s, first with the duo Company Flow and lately as a busy producer and the founder of the Definitive Jux label. Party chants and drugs-and-bling boasts are not for him; he sees trouble in the streets and around the world. His second solo album, ''I'll Sleep When You're Dead'' (Definitive Jux), is sonically dense and verbally pugnacious: ''Either speak the truth or you leave toothless,'' he warns. ''This is the sound of what you don't know killing you/This is the sound of what you don't believe, still true.'' Saturday at 8 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20.</p>
