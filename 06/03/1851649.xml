        <p>Eliane Zbinden, 29, a teacher from Fribourg, Switzerland. ''In Alausí, this small locomotive awaited us. For a few minutes, all these cultivated people forgot their manners -- there was pushing and shoving and swearing. Naturally, everyone wanted a place on the roof. The lucky ones had a place to sit and the unlucky ones sat squeezed into the middle. Surrounded by all these tourists, I was thrown back and forth. On one hand, I enjoyed the trip and the view; on the other hand, I felt rather unwell and squeezed in. When one moves through a landscape devoid of people, in such a situation, thousands of things float through the head: What still lies ahead for me? Have I made the right decision to be here? Should I be here? Oh, well. For one and a half hours, one has quite a bit of time to think.''</p>
