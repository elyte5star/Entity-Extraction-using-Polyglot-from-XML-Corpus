        <p>Will MacKenzie's hobbies include heliboarding in Alaska and surfing in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>In his 20s, he spent five years in Montana living out of a sleeping bag in his van.</p>
        <p>Between rock climbing and kayaking, he makes a living hitting golf shots on the PGA Tour. And buying interesting clothes.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to get some alligator belts,'' said MacKenzie, 32, who shot a seven-under-par 65 on Saturday at the Memorial Tournament to trail the leader, Rod Pampling, by four shots. ''I'm tired of my belts.''</p>
        <p>Pampling, with a 68 and a 15-under 201, led Adam Scott (72) and Sean O'Hair (69) by three shots, while Stewart Cink (65) and Aaron Baddeley (71) were also four back at Muirfield Village Golf Club. The third round was delayed by 2 hours 32 minutes because of thunderstorms. With storms predicted again for Sunday, the final round will begin at 8 a.m., and the golfers will play in threesomes.</p>
        <p>MacKenzie, from Greenville, N.C., has taken an unconventional route to the PGA Tour. A former junior golf prodigy, he quit the game for 10 years after his sophomore year in high school and set off into nature.</p>
        <p>He went to Durango, Colo., and Jackson Hole, Wyo. He washed dishes and sold hammocks. He moonlighted as a security guard. He grew his hair long.</p>
        <p>''Just wanted to do something different,'' MacKenzie said recently. ''I was a little bummed out my summers were being taken up by golf.''</p>
        <p>He did not start playing again until Payne Stewart won the 1999 United States Open in Pinehurst, N.C., a victory that MacKenzie said inspired him.</p>
        <p>He turned professional the next year and bounced around the minitour circuit before earning his PGA Tour card at qualifying school in 2004 and 2005.</p>
        <p>He won the Reno-Tahoe Open last year, his lone Tour victory. The event was played opposite the Bridgestone Invitational, won by Tiger Woods against a stronger field.</p>
        <p>While MacKenzie has thrived on the fairways and greens of Muirfield Village, he still seems like an outsider in professional golf. He refers to his life story as ''the adventures of Willy Mac.''</p>
        <p>Some of his peers are just learning about him.</p>
        <p>''Will MacKenzie?'' O'Hair said. ''I've heard a little about his story, what he did, and it's pretty interesting. That's definitely a good story to sit down and listen to over a drink or something.''</p>
        <p>MacKenzie said that he spent most of the weather delay eating shrimp and eavesdropping on Woods's conversations.</p>
        <p>''Whenever he says something to me like, 'What's up, Will?' I say, 'Hey, Tiger,' '' MacKenzie said. ''I only said two words to him. Shoot, any time I get to hang out near Tiger Woods, it makes me pretty happy. I barely even talked to him, but I was just hanging out with him. He just puts off a real nice vibe. He is the man. I mean, that guy is unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Woods has struggled at Muirfield Village, though. His two-under 70 left him 11 shots behind Pampling. He continued to miss chances on the greens -- he needed 31 putts for the second consecutive day -- but said he was trending in the right direction two weeks before the United States Open at Oakmont Country Club.</p>
        <p>Last year, he missed the cut at the championship at Winged Foot Golf Club.</p>
        <p>''I made progress this week,'' Woods said. ''Compared to where I hit it at TPC, I've come a long way,'' he said, referring to the Players Championship.</p>
        <p>Even though he led Woods, the No. 1 player in the world, by seven shots, MacKenzie all but bowed to him.</p>
        <p>''He'll probably shoot 58 tomorrow,'' he said.</p>
        <p>MacKenzie acknowledges that he borrows elements from the repertories of other players. Sometimes he copies Steve Elkington's swing. Other weeks, it's Stuart Appleby's. He is channeling Appleby at the Memorial, he said.</p>
        <p>And the putting stroke? ''Aaron Baddeley,'' MacKenzie said. ''I went back to that this week and I putted fantastic.''</p>
        <p>But Woods is the golfer MacKenzie seems most smitten with.</p>
        <p>''Just the way he walks,'' MacKenzie said. ''Everything he does, he sort of flows, like water, like a breeze.''</p>
