        <p>Ravi Aggarwal, not realizing that he had stirred controversy, decides to change name of his new shop, Arena Bagels and Bialys in Park Slope, Brooklyn; 20 to 25 people who oppose proposed Barclays Center Arena, part of Atlantic Yards development, have stopped by to complain about shop's name (M)</p>

        <p>It seemed like a harmless enough name, but when Ravi Aggarwal decided to call his new shop Arena Bagels and Bialys, he learned otherwise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aggarwal's two teenage children had suggested the name after reading online about the planned new home of the New Jersey Nets.

        <p>It seemed like a harmless enough name, but when Ravi Aggarwal decided to call his new shop Arena Bagels and Bialys, he learned otherwise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aggarwal's two teenage children had suggested the name after reading online about the planned new home of the New Jersey Nets. He thought it was a smart idea; the shop is in Park Slope, a few blocks from the site of the proposed Barclays Center arena, part of the Atlantic Yards development.</p>
        <p>So, in mid-April, workers installed the name in red letters above the new store on Fifth Avenue near Bergen Street. Soon, however, workers in the space began noticing negative reactions from passers-by.</p>
        <p>''Four out of five people that walked by just stood and stared at the sign,'' said Rich Kahn III, who helped his father install the bagel oven and water kettle. His father added that one sarcastic passer-by remarked, '' 'Oh, yeah, he's going to do good business with that name.' ''</p>
        <p>A few people even entered the shop to complain. And then a few more. In all, Mr. Aggarwal said, 20 or 25 unhappy people trooped in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aggarwal, whose plight was reported in The Brooklyn Paper, quickly figured out that a word that is innocuous in Queens -- he lives in Forest Hills, near one of his other two bagel shops -- may be anything but innocuous in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''I didn't have any idea anyone was against it,'' Mr. Aggarwal said of the Atlantic Yards project. ''I just wanted to get into the neighborhood.'' (The developer of the Atlantic Yards, Forest City Ratner, was the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company.)</p>
        <p>Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, which opposes the Atlantic Yards project, was not surprised at the outcry. ''People in central Brooklyn are not shy about expressing their opinions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aggarwal stresses that he is happy to cede the field. ''The name is nothing to me,'' he said. ''I don't want any controversy.''</p>
        <p>What will the new name be? Mr. Aggarwal is not 100 percent sure, but he is considering removing the ''n'' and calling the place Area Bagels and Bialys. The cost of this lesson learned about Brooklyn: $1,000.</p>
        <p>For now, the offending word is covered by a little banner. It says, ''Coming Soon.''</p>
