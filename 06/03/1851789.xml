        <p>IN the sloping, misshapen dirt parking lot at Peter Pratt's Inn, more than two dozen men, women and children, ranging in age from 7 to 60, clapped and cheered as they took turns tossing small, gleaming steel balls into the dust.</p>
        <p>For lovers of pétanque, an outdoor sport popular in the south of France, a place to play and enough players for two teams are reasons to cheer.</p>
        <p>''It's 50 percent sport and 50 percent a good time,'' said Jonathan Pratt, 48, the owner of Peter Pratt's, who, begged by a group of French patrons, agreed to lend them his parking lot on Tuesday nights, when the restaurant is closed.</p>
        <p>When he worked in Westchester for a French food manufacturer, Mr. Pratt said, he used to play the game at every opportunity.</p>
        <p>Pétanque (pronounced pay-TONK), a century-old form of French lawn bowling that resembles Italian boccie, is played by two teams of one, two or three players each. The aim is to toss, or roll, steel balls as close as possible to a tiny wooden target ball called a cochonnet, or piglet. The team that finishes closest to the cochonnet wins.</p>
        <p>Jean-Luc Portal, 51, a wine consultant in Somers who grew up in the tiny village of Alzonne in southern France, said he became obsessed with the game when he was 6. A former champion in France, Mr. Portal displayed his expertise when he crouched low to appraise the ground before each turn.</p>
        <p>He was surprised and delighted to see so many Americans trying his beloved sport. ''It's fun and relaxing,'' he said. ''It's easy to play.''</p>
        <p>Steve Bluestone, 49, a real estate developer from Manhattan, and his wife, Kathy, 48, were playing for the first time. ''It's kind of like golf without clubs and a ball and a badly maintained course,'' he said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Eve Hartman, 45, a personal trainer from Cortlandt Manor, was playing with her two children, Tess Willinger, 7, and Emma Willinger, 9.</p>
        <p>''The kids like to play boccie with their grandparents,'' she said. ''It's something different to do, not just another soccer game or soccer event.''</p>
        <p>The games begin at 6:30 p.m. every Tuesday night until Oct. 23 and are open to anyone who would like to try.</p>
        <p>Punctuated with cheers and coaching tips in French, Italian and Spanish, the evening became a micro-Olympics beneath the circling crows and tall pines. Only as the sun disappeared did the players reluctantly pack up their silver spheres, eager for the next round.</p>
