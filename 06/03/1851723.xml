        <p>To the Editor: ''36 Hours; St. Petersburg, Russia'' (May 13) makes travel with children to St. Petersburg, Russia, sound as easy as a trip to St. Petersburg, Fla. Is there more than one Russia? This Russia sounds very much like Western Europe. The Russia I visited is very far away -- a miserable distance to fly with children -- and I can't believe the author recommended using Aeroflot, with its terrible reputation.</p>
        <p>I didn't read anywhere in the article that the State Department and most Russians will tell you not to drink -- or even brush your teeth with -- the local tap water. Nor did the story include State Department warnings to get updated tetanus and diphtheria immunizations (and preferably immunized against hepatitis A, too) prior to the trip.</p>

        <p>St. Petersburg also has a problem with beggars, pickpockets and muggers, not generally considered kid-friendly. And last but not least, the author minimized language barriers: the Russian alphabet is not the English one. Once I was off the beaten track, few people I encountered could communicate in English.</p>
        <p>Elaine Rowland  San Jose, Calif.</p>
        <p>To the Editor: Having visited St. Petersburg in February 1994, I found the recent article on the city a testament to how much has changed in the now-tourist-and-free-enterprise-friendly town. 15 years ago, there were few cars, no limousines, few restaurants and somber citizens.</p>
        <p>The winter when I visited was cold, damp and snowy, not flakes but little pellets of ice. It was also the 50th anniversary of the end of the siege of Leningrad. I couldn't help thinking of those 900 days immortalized by Harrison Salisbury of The New York Times, and I wonder how any travel writer today could take pen to paper without words honoring the citizens and history of that ravished city.</p>
        <p>When we were there, my wife and I made a pilgrimage to the cemetery on the edge of town. Its row after row of somber rectangular memorials melted into the earth and the gray-white snow. No words were needed: the silence spoke of Mother Russia.</p>
        <p>There was an amphitheater of sorts upon which was a gold and black wreath -- a tribute from the German Republic. We carried a small American flag and placed it on the cold stone.</p>
