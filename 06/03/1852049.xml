        <p>After a recent two-day follow-up examination, the Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow has regained full accreditation.</p>
        <p>Arthur A. Gianelli, the president and chief executive of the Nassau Health Care Corporation, which runs the center, announced on May 24 that it had been removed from conditional accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.</p>
        <p>The accreditation ensures the medical center's eligibility for millions of dollars from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.</p>
        <p>Last May the commission listed 15 general requirements for improvement at the medical center and three at the A. Holly Patterson Extended Care Center, a nursing home, which also had conditional accreditation. Specific issues that needed to be addressed included unlocked medication carts, inadequate recording of the temperature of refrigerators storing medications, improper abbreviations on patient charts, and jagged edges on equipment on the hospital's psychiatric floor.</p>
        <p>Corrective actions included weekly meetings to evaluate areas that needed improvement, teams created to address specific problems, building repairs, a new system of record keeping, and surprise surveys on different floors to simulate those of the accrediting commission.</p>
        <p>After a surprise two-day visit in April by the commission, the medical center and nursing center were returned to full accreditation.</p>
        <p>The commission, a private organization created in 1951 to improve health care through voluntary accreditation, evaluates 80 percent of the nation's hospitals. A commission survey, which is typically held every three years, is paid for by the hospital. The survey at Nassau University Medical Center cost $30,000.</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven J. Walerstein, the medical center's medical director, said: ''Our job was not to prepare for the next visit of the commission, but to bring up the level of care. We have let our staff know that we have new expectations and standards.''</p>
        <p>The Nassau Health Care Corporation consists of the medical center, a Level I trauma center and teaching hospital, the A. Holly Patterson nursing home and seven community health centers.</p>
