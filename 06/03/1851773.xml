        <p>THE mountain laurel, Connecticut's state flower, was blooming in New England when the earliest settlers arrived. Today, on roadsides in suburban gardens, pink and white clouds of blossoms flourish every June from Florida to Maine.</p>
        <p>At the Broken Arrow Nursery in Hamden, 25 acres of woodland hold 60 different mountain laurel species in shades of pink and white with markings in red, purple and maroon. Fanciful names, like Peppermint and Freckles, describe patterns found in the parachute-shaped blossoms.</p>
        <p>Naming them, said the nursery's owner, Richard A. Jaynes, is ''like buying a pair of new shoes.''</p>
        <p>''You have to try them on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaynes asks customers to suggest names for new cultivars. ''Sarah,'' named after his wife, is a personal favorite, with dark red buds and pinkish-red flowers.</p>
        <p>For 40 years, Mr. Jaynes, who wrote ''Kalmia: Mountain Laurel and Related Species'' (Timber Press, 1997), has developed, and named, new cultivars, a process that can take five years from seed to flower. (The fruit of his labors can be seen at the nursery's annual Mountain Laurel Open House next weekend.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaynes, who earned a doctorate in botany from Yale, worked for 25 years at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, specializing in chestnut trees and laurels. A Yale Forestry School student drew his attention to the little-researched native mountain laurel, and he was hooked.</p>
        <p>So far, he says, he has not seen the perfect plant, one that combines disease and insect resistance with attractive blossoms and leaves and is also easy to propagate. He continues to cross and develop new cultivars searching for unique plants. He created the Elf mountain laurel, a slow-growing, small-leaf plant, by caging six miniature laurels with a bumble bee. ''That was in 1976, and I still have some of that seed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ideal planting time for laurels is the early spring or fall, although they can be planted whenever the ground can be worked.</p>
        <p>Despite persistent rumors, the mountain laurel receives no more protection under state law than other plants.</p>
        <p>''If it's on someone's property, no plant can be dug or picked without permission,'' said Glenn D. Dreyer, director of the Connecticut College Arboretum.</p>
