        <p>During the first set of her third-round match Saturday, Amélie Mauresmo felt a twinge in her right groin, and right then, her chances at winning the French Open vanished.</p>
        <p>Even after a doctor wrapped her leg, the fifth-seeded Mauresmo said the injury continued to bother her, causing her to lose to Lucie Safarova, 6-3, 7-6 (3).</p>
        <p>''There's no miracle today,'' she said. ''I've been struggling for weeks now, and as I said coming here at the French Open, I didn't really know what to expect.''</p>
        <p>Safarova, seeded 25th, also defeated Mauresmo at the Australian Open this year in the fourth round, preventing Mauresmo from repeating as the champion at that Grand Slam event.</p>
        <p>Mauresmo won the Australian Open and Wimbledon last year, in her best season as a professional. Those victories took the pressure off her coming into the French Open, she said.</p>
        <p>The furthest she has advanced at Roland Garros has been the quarterfinals, twice.</p>
        <p>As the highest-seeded Frenchwoman, Mauresmo was the fan favorite here, with the crowd chanting her name Saturday even as she exited the court.</p>
        <p>But for Mauresmo, winning her first French Open was a long shot. She had her appendix removed in March, so her preparation for this tournament had not been as smooth as planned. Safarova took advantage of that.</p>
        <p>''It was very tough,'' Safarova said. ''I was very nervous at the beginning because I know that the crowd is for her.</p>
        <p>''I tried to come for each point, to play aggressive. I think that's why I won.''</p>
