        <p>Road &amp; Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary  By John Dinkel  250 pages. Bentley Publishers. $19.95</p>
        <p>For many people, automotive mechanics will always be one of the everlasting mysteries of life. Trips to the dealership for service or even combing through car reviews seem to entail a certain amount of technical decoding, which inevitably leads to head-scratching and frustration.</p>
        <p>The staff of Road &amp; Track magazine had these laypeople in mind when it came up with its original Illustrated Automotive Dictionary in 1977.</p>
        <p>Since then, there have been all sorts of breakthroughs in automotive technology, from antilock brakes to drive-by-wire throttles to the continuously variable transmission. A few years ago, John Dinkel, who was Road &amp; Track's editor in chief at the time of the original publication, updated the dictionary to include these advances. The latest edition contains more than 1,300 definitions and 435 black-and-white photographs and illustrations.</p>
        <p>The latest edition arrived in 2000, just before the recent boom in environmental awareness, and there is a huge gap in the dictionary regarding alternative fuels. Ethanol made the cut, but other newfound catchwords, like biodiesel, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell, didn't.</p>
