        <p>COMETS, STARS, THE MOON, AND MARS</p>
        <p>Space Poems and Paintings.</p>
        <p>Written and illustrated by Douglas Florian.</p>
        <p>45 pp. Harcourt. $16. (Ages 5 to 10)</p>
        <p>In space, no one can hear you giggle. Except maybe Douglas Florian.</p>
        <p>The poet-painter's latest book brings warm wit to the outermost reaches of cold, dark space. Twenty short poems paired with paintings on double-page spreads create an interstellar journey, starting with ''Skywatch,'' an invitation to the pleasures of amateur astronomy. The book travels through our solar system and ends up in the somewhat vaguer territory of comets, black holes and ''the Great Beyond.'' At the end, there's a ''galactic glossary'' and a short bibliography with suggestions for further reading. (Tots demanding ''A Brief History of Time''? Blame this book!)</p>
        <p>Florian's illustrations depict the marvels of space with luminous texture and detail. Painted in gouache on brown paper bags, they're littered with a secondary text of rubber-stamped words and collaged with scraps of star maps, photographs and other surprises. Die-cut, circular peepholes give glimpses of stars and planets from neighboring pages.</p>
        <p>The most engaging verses in ''Comets, Stars'' serve up planetary facts with a dose of cheeky humor. Take, for example, ''Venus'': ''Scalding-hot surface, / Nine hundred degrees. / Nothing can live there, / No creatures, / No trees. / Poisonous clouds / Of acid above. / Why was it named for / the goddess of love?'' Or ''Pluto,'' a riff on cosmic injustice: ''Pluto was a planet. / But now it doesn't pass. / Pluto was a planet. / They say it's lacking mass. / Pluto was a planet. / Pluto was admired. / Pluto was a planet. / Till one day it got fired.'' Poor Pluto!</p>
        <p>It should be noted that these are standout stanzas. Some of Florian's poems stumble on lumpy rhymes or fall flat (see ''The Comet,'' which begins: ''Ice, rock, dirt / Metal and gas -- / Around the sun / A comet may pass.'') Previous books better showcase his lively writing with subjects that are -- quite literally -- alive. His ''Insectlopedia'' and ''Mammalabilia'' offer hilarious observations of animals, while collections like ''Winter Eyes'' find poignancy in the shared seasonal rituals of human beings. Until we find life on Mars, Florian's most enjoyable work will probably stay rooted here, on plain old planet Earth.</p>
