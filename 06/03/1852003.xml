        <p>On the eve of a presidential debate in New Hampshire, five Democratic candidates made a quick detour to Iowa on Saturday evening to appeal to nearly 1,000 party activists, seeking to distinguish themselves to the voters who will open the 2008 nominating fight.</p>
        <p>At the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame dinner, a parade of presidential hopefuls assailed President Bush's conduct of the Iraq war. Yet as the evening wore on, two candidates, John Edwards and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also suggested that their Democratic rivals in Congress have not done enough to end the war.</p>
        <p>''Now is not the time for careful, it is not the time for cautious, it is not the time for political calculation,'' said Mr. Edwards, a former North Carolina senator. ''It is the time for strength, it is the time for backbone, it is the time for courage, it is the time for bold, visionary leadership. And the place that begins is on the war in Iraq.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said Congress should move to de-authorize the Iraq war before adjourning for its summer break. The Democratic-sponsored ''amendments and bills that cut funding and set timetables are not working.''</p>
        <p>''There is no validity to this war,'' Mr. Richardson said, ''especially at a time when the American people are saying no.''</p>
        <p>The dinner was intended to be the first opportunity for Iowa Democratic activists to see the party's candidates in the same room. But those plans were foiled when Senator Barack Obama of Illinois declined to change a West Coast fund-raising schedule to attend the dinner.</p>
        <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, sought to take advantage of her rival's absence. She took a seat at a table in the middle of the convention center ballroom, dining with party activists after mingling throughout the room.</p>
        <p>She touched briefly on Iraq during her remarks, and focused instead on a general criticism of the Bush administration. ''People are ready for a change,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''In fact, they'd like to push the restart button on the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, walked into a convention hall plastered with Dodd signs. ''You give people like me a chance to be heard,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''You have a habit of proving the pundits wrong.''</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, arrived as the event was under way. He, too, had come here after spending the morning and afternoon in New Hampshire, where he intended to return at the conclusion of the Iowa dinner.</p>
        <p>He criticized his rivals for suggesting that Democrats in Congress had not done enough to change the administration's Iraq policy. ''I love the platitudes, having the Congress end the war tomorrow,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I love those platitudes.''</p>
        <p>He ended, though, on a light note, firing a gentle shot at Mr. Edwards, who has spent considerable time explaining an expensive haircut he paid for with campaign money earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''I wish my hair was worth $400,'' said Mr. Biden, who was quickly drowned out by the crowd's laughter.</p>
