        <p>In ''The Merchant of Venice,'' when Tubal learned the whereabouts of his friend Shylock's runaway daughter, Jessica, Shylock didn't have to wait long for the news in the Theater for a New Audience production this year. He got a call from Tubal on his cellphone.</p>
        <p>The moment, however, wasn't played for comedy, as the anachronism easily might have been. Shylock's anguish at having lost a daughter and part of his fortune to a Christian husband registered just as acutely -- perhaps more so -- for the Jewish father having no friend by his side to comfort him, only that friend's distant, mechanized voice.</p>
        <p>Darko Tresnjak's sleek, modern-day production in February, starring F. Murray Abraham as Shylock, was littered with such technological touches. Adjusting his position onstage to receive a better signal, Portia's preening assistant received calls from her suitors on a cordless headset. The three famous caskets containing the riddles the suitors have to answer to win Portia's hand were Mac PowerBooks. When activated, each laptop released a bells-and-whistles video letting the would-be husband know if he had chosen well or badly.</p>
        <p>In another director's hands these flourishes might have seemed like so much eye-catching tinsel. But Mr. Tresnjak fully integrated them into his vision of a modern-day Venice as chilly, sleek and calculating as any Wall Street house: a world where all exchanges -- monetary, marital, fraternal, emotional -- are coolly commodified, and where any weakness is quickly exploited and the raid then rationalized as ''just business.''</p>
