        <p>Re ''Grooming a Handwriting Champion,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, May 27):</p>
        <p>My son would benefit greatly if there were penmanship classes offered in public school. Every year I complain to my son's teacher that his handwriting is awful. The usual response is ''It doesn't matter, he can type on the computer'' or ''It's fine, I've seen worse.''</p>

        <p>Re ''Grooming a Handwriting Champion,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, May 27):</p>
        <p>My son would benefit greatly if there were penmanship classes offered in public school. Every year I complain to my son's teacher that his handwriting is awful. The usual response is ''It doesn't matter, he can type on the computer'' or ''It's fine, I've seen worse.''</p>
        <p>I receive a similar answer when I bemoan his appalling spelling: ''There is spell check.'' Apparently reading illegible handwriting and deciphering horrible spelling are just part of teacher training.</p>
        <p>With this same line of reasoning, why do children have to spend an enormous time learning advanced math concepts when during our day to day life all we ever need to calculate is easily handled with a calculator? When was the last time you were asked to solve a quadratic equation? When was the last time you received a thank you note with misspelled words and that was impossible to read?</p>
