        <p>LAWRENCE WRIGHT told you so. He is too polite to put it that way of course. But anyone who saw ''The Siege,'' the 1998 film he helped write about a wave of terrorist bombings in New York City, knows that he was prescient about many things.</p>
        <p>After Sept. 11, Mr. Wright, a writer for The New Yorker, thought the tragedy was familiar. ''This looks like my movie,'' he said in ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' a fascinating slide show and monologue that had a six-week run this spring. The play is based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ''The Looming Tower,'' which was the product of more than 600 interviews, many with terrorists. The show closed in April, but there are two more chances to see it this week, when Mr. Wright returns for encore performances at Town Hall. On Tuesday there will be a post-show talk moderated by Aziz Huq, the director of the Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. On Wednesday the post-show moderator is David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com; $25 and $40.</p>
        <p>For those who want to forget about terror threats and enjoy ''Summer's ripening breath,'' as Shakespeare puts it, the Public Theater begins its Delacorte Theater season with that romantic old story about Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet. OSCAR ISAAC, who starred in the Central Park production of ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' in 2005, will do his best to charm the red-headed beauty LAUREN AMBROSE, who played the moody Claire on the HBO series ''Six Feet Under.'' Michael Greif (''Rent'') directs this crowd-pleaser, which hasn't been produced in Central Park since 1968, when it starred Martin Sheen as Romeo. That's surprising since the play can be lovely to watch outdoors. When Romeo swears by the moon, why, there it is. Previews start Tuesday at 8 p.m., Delacorte Theater, Central Park, (212) 539-8500, publictheater.org.</p>
