        <p>The Classic Era  By Beverly Rae Kimes  Illustrated. 720 pages. Classic Car Club of America, 2001.</p>
        <p>The author presents a detailed year-by-year rundown of the American and European auto industry from 1925 through 1948, but don't expect any mention of plebeian Chevrolets, Fords or Dodges. As the title implies, this is a chronicle of the kings (and princes) of the road -- the higher-priced brands like Stutz, Cord, Auburn and Rolls-Royce (particularly the cars from the American factory in Springfield, Mass.).</p>

        <p>The Classic Era  By Beverly Rae Kimes  Illustrated. 720 pages. Classic Car Club of America, 2001.</p>
        <p>The author presents a detailed year-by-year rundown of the American and European auto industry from 1925 through 1948, but don't expect any mention of plebeian Chevrolets, Fords or Dodges. As the title implies, this is a chronicle of the kings (and princes) of the road -- the higher-priced brands like Stutz, Cord, Auburn and Rolls-Royce (particularly the cars from the American factory in Springfield, Mass.).</p>
        <p>Each chapter is a thorough almanac of the year's activities, including executive shuffling; a necrology of the marques that went under; and the latest engineering breakthroughs. Ms. Kimes is a facile writer, so the wheels never become mired. Besides, there are plenty of photos to linger over.</p>
        <p>Not that there is any reason to hurry to the end of this book: we all know who's left standing, for example, in the Packard-Cadillac showdown. And the palette of body colors forced a buyer to choose among whimsically named shades like Fenimore and Laurel (two greens) or Yedaz (tan). Even then, luxury had its price.</p>
