        <p>A recent sampling of a dozen Long Island sauvignon blancs showed that they easily compete with local chardonnays for meals and perhaps have an edge as aperitifs. Generally, they go nicely with seafood.</p>
        <p>Sauvignon flourishes on the East End. These quintessentially summer whites should never be iced; they are maximally expressive when moderately chilled. They tend to be most appealing when produced in steel tanks or in tanks plus neutral barrels that impart virtually no woody flavors. This approach preserves intact their aromas, fruitiness and zest.</p>

        <p>A recent sampling of a dozen Long Island sauvignon blancs showed that they easily compete with local chardonnays for meals and perhaps have an edge as aperitifs. Generally, they go nicely with seafood.</p>
        <p>Sauvignon flourishes on the East End. These quintessentially summer whites should never be iced; they are maximally expressive when moderately chilled. They tend to be most appealing when produced in steel tanks or in tanks plus neutral barrels that impart virtually no woody flavors. This approach preserves intact their aromas, fruitiness and zest.</p>
        <p>Sauvignon blanc has long been a strength at Castello di Borghese, Channing Daughters Winery, Jamesport Vineyards, Macari, Palmer and Raphael, varying in quality with the vintage.</p>
        <p>In the tasting, Raphael's 2006 ($22) was brilliant, a tribute to the vineyard manager, Steve Mudd, and the winemaker, Richard Olsen-Harbich. Perfumed, vibrant, tangy, juicy, citric, complex -- it has everything.</p>
        <p>Jamesport's world-class 2006 ($21.95) finished in second place. Powerfully herbaceous, full of zip and flash, it is a satisfying mouthful.</p>
        <p>Channing Daughters' 2006 ($20), from 91 percent sauvignon and 9 percent chardonnay grapes harvested in the Mudd Vineyard in Southold, finished third; it is very aromatic, deep, broad and complex.</p>
        <p>Sharing fourth place, Shinn's 2006 First Fruit ($23), 96 percent sauvignon and 4 percent s√©millon, tasted of grapefruit and figs. Macari's 2006 ($18.99) is a crowd-pleaser; light, a bit herblike and palate-cleansing, it delivers hints of tropical fruits, especially melon.</p>
        <p>Several wines occupied the next rung down. Palmer's 2006 ($16.99) was fresh, amiable and piquant with a strong hint of apple. Paumanok's 2006 ($22), somewhat tropical and appetite-quickening, was equally pleasant. Another Channing Daughters version, the regular 2006 ($24), 82 percent sauvignon and 18 percent chardonnay, was full of subtleties.</p>
        <p>Martha Clara's 2006 ($16.99) was light, smooth and crisp. Borghese's 2006 ($17.99), suggesting a chardonnay's girth, was agreeable and workmanlike. Duck Walk's 2004 ($12.95) resembled decent carafe wine. Pindar's 2005 ($12.99) was simply vin ordinaire.</p>
