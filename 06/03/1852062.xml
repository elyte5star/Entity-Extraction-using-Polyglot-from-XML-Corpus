        <p>Surf rivalries are generally rather tame affairs, but consider the opening salvo in the war between Ken Bradshaw and Mark Foo, as told in Andy Martin's new book, ''Stealing the Wave'' (Bloomsbury, $24.95). Bradshaw and Foo were the premier big-wave surfers at Hawaii's Waimea Bay, and one morning in the mid-1980s, Foo ''dropped in'' on Bradshaw -- meaning he co-opted his wave. Bradshaw flew into a De Niro-esque rage -- You're dropping in on me? -- and exacted his revenge by clotheslining Foo and taking a bite out of his favorite surfboard. It makes charging the mound seem tame by comparison.</p>
        <p>Bradshaw and Foo spent a decade snarling at each other, with casual slights in surfing magazines and confrontations at the beach. Martin describes Waimea in its pretourist state as a place of rigid social codes, where surfers enforced the decorum and a proper pecking order. And as he pushes toward the story's tragic finale (Foo died while surfing at California's infamous Maverick's break while Bradshaw bobbed in the water nearby), Martin manages to make the two men seem like they're battling not only for the hearts and minds of Brazilian groupies but for the fate of big-wave surfing itself. When hate seeps through the sunbaked haze of Hawaii, it is something truly majestic to behold.</p>
