        <p>The summer-long River to River Festival, which begins this weekend, offers more than 500 free performances and arts events throughout Lower Manhattan. These restaurants, which are among the newer dining spots in the area, are all short walks from many of the festival sites.</p>
        <p>BROUWERS OF STONE STREET  (212) 785-5400; 45 Stone Street (South William Street); $$; Article: 6/14/06.</p>
        <p>Evoking old New York, this restaurant anchors one end of what was the first paved street in Manhattan. The menu, by Michael Sullivan, formerly of Chanterelle and Le Zinc, includes Gold Coast steamers, a raw bar, and rack of lamb with mint au jus and butternut squash and roasted potatoes; and pan-seared salmon with sautéed cabbage and pears and a smoked apple bacon sauce.</p>
        <p>GOLD ST.  (212) 747-0797; 2 Gold Street (Maiden Lane); $$; Article: 4/11/07.</p>
        <p>Peter Poulakakos, who owns Harry's Cafe and Harry's Steak on Hanover Square with his father, Harry, recently opened this sleek upscale 24-hour diner and sushi bar with Michael Jewell and Danny McDonald, who are his partners in Ulysses Folk House on Pearl Street.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is the focus of this new pub-style place in the South Street Seaport. Eric Lind, formerly of Flatbush Farm, is the chef.</p>
        <p>The menu includes New Zealand venison sausage with red cabbage and apple-cherry chutney; New Zealand style crabcakes with lemon and citrus tartar sauce; lamb or fisherman's pot pie; and grilled items like lamb chops, salmon or chicken.</p>

        <p>TRINITY PLACE  (212) 964-0939; 115 Broadway (entrance on Cedar Street); $$; Article: 6/14/06.</p>
        <p>The former United States Realty Bank Vault, a landmark built in the 19th century, has become a restaurant. The entrance is through the huge door of what was a giant safe. Donal Crosbie, who worked at Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe, is the chef. His menu offers contemporary fare kissed a bit by Europe (duck confit with spring vegetable risotto) and Asia (Vietnamese style pork or chicken sandwiches).</p>
