        <p>THE Suffolk County Republican Party has endorsed a Democrat for county executive for the first time, giving its support to Steve Levy for re-election.</p>
        <p>Harry Withers, the county's Republican Party chairman, said there were practical and philosophical reasons for endorsing Mr. Levy in the November election.</p>
        <p>''On a practical note, Mr. Levy was going to win in big numbers, no matter what we did,'' Mr. Withers said of the May 24 endorsement. ''He is both the incumbent and very popular. If he won by a landslide, it would have hurt us with other candidates in the future.</p>
        <p>''Philosophically, Mr. Levy shares the strong stand that the Republican Party has taken on immigration.''</p>
        <p>When asked if the endorsement was a reflection of a weakening party, Mr. Wither answered: ''It was a pragmatic decision. Why go into a race you cannot win?''</p>
        <p>In nominating Mr. Levy, Mr. Withers acknowledged that the Republicans did not have a strong candidate to challenge him.</p>
        <p>The last potential Republican candidate, Steve Lynch, a law clerk for Justice Robert A. Lifson of the Appellate Division, dropped out, saying his job was too demanding to allow time for campaigning.</p>
        <p>Several other Republican leaders had already endorsed Mr. Levy, including Legislator Joseph Caracappa and former Legislator Paul J. Tonna; Mitchell H. Pally, a lawyer and former business lobbyist; and John Zollo, a former Smithtown town attorney.</p>
        <p>It is also the first time a major party on Long Island has endorsed the other party's candidate for county executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, who was elected in 2003, was enthusiastic about the endorsement.</p>
        <p>''My politics have hit a chord with the mainstream,'' he said. ''While I am fiscally conservative, I am also aggressive on fighting crime and protecting the environment, and this combination is appreciated by the vast majority.''</p>
