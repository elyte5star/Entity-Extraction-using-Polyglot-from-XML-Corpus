        <p>Those impatient for Prince William to wed should instead visit Buckingham Palace this summer, where they can experience Queen Elizabeth's royal wedding all over again -- or for the first time. From July 28 to Sept. 25 an exhibition will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the marriage of Elizabeth, then a princess, to the Duke of Edinburgh in November 1947.</p>
        <p>The recreation of their wedding day at Westminster Abbey will include archival films of behind-the-scenes preparations and celebrations that took place all over the nation. On display will be the outfits worn by the wedding party, including Princess Elizabeth's dress, right (which along with its 13-foot train had 10,000 seed pearls), the jewels she wore (a Russian fringe tiara made for her grandmother, Queen Mary), and even her shoes.</p>

        <p>One can also check out some of the 2,500 royal gifts the couple received : President Truman gave an engraved Steuben bowl, while Gandhi's gift was a piece of lace he had woven by hand. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth gave their daughter a 19th-century sapphire and diamond necklace and Cartier diamond chandelier earrings.</p>
        <p>But would-be William wives take note. The queen's marriage, in contrast to most of her family's, has lasted the longest of any reigning sovereign.</p>
        <p>Entry to the exhibition is included in the Â£15 admission, or about $30 at $2.01 to the pound, to the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace. More information is at www.royalcollection.org.uk.</p>
