        <p>COVERING THE BASES</p>
        <p>Balk Talk  Armando BenÍtez, who was traded to the Marlins from the Giants on Thursday, was called for two balks in the 12th inning against the Mets two days earlier; the second balk allowed the tying run to score. On May 4, 1963, Bob Shaw of the Milwaukee Braves tied the record for the most balks in an inning with three and set the record for balks in a game with five.</p>
        <p>Hot Hand  John Lackey of the Angels (9-3, 2.37 earned run average) is scheduled to start against the Twins on Wednesday. Lackey has won his last five starts.</p>
        <p>Rookie Watch  Troy Tulowitzki of the Rockies leads all rookies with 53 base hits. Colorado will be home against the Astros for a series that begins Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Streak on the Line  Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak on Friday to 25 games, a Mariners record. It is the sixth time in his career that he has hit safely in 20 or more straight games. Three other active players have at least three streaks of 20 or more games: Nomar Garciaparra of the Dodgers (five), Vladimir Guerrero of the Angels (three) and Manny RamÍrez of the Red Sox (three).</p>
        <p>Milestone Tracker  Frank Thomas is five home runs from 500 and one from 244 as a designated hitter, which would break Edgar Martinez's record. Toronto will be home for a three-game set against Tampa Bay beginning Tuesday, then goes on the road against the Dodgers and the Giants.</p>
        <p>PLAYERS TO WATCH</p>
        <p>Chone Figgins, below, might have gotten the message. Figgins, the Angels' starting third baseman, was hitting .133 last week when Erick Aybar, a highly regarded prospect who is normally a middle infielder, started at third. Figgins, after having two days off, collected three hits and stole two bases. Aybar was 0 for 4 in his first start at third and is batting just .252. Figgins has long been the Angels' spark plug and figures to remain a regular.</p>
        <p>Jorge Julio, Byung-Hyun Kim and now Armando Benítez. The Marlins have a thing for frustrated closers. But Benítez, in addition to having a hittable fastball and an inclination to implode, is also dealing with a knee problem. The team's current closer, Kevin Gregg, should not have to look over his shoulder, unless, of course, it is to worry about the previous closer, Henry Owens, who came off the disabled list Thursday.</p>
        <p>Robinson Canó has struggled along with many of his Yankees teammates, batting .264 through the first two months. But Canó likes the warm weather. He has batted .273 in April and May in his career, then .333 the rest of the season. Canó started June with a homer against Boston's Tim Wakefield.</p>
