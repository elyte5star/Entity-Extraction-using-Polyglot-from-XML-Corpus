        <p>Of all the whining about gentrification in Brooklyn, this may be the first time the complaints have been set to an energetic beat with a bass line, a violin interlude and backup vocals.</p>
        <p>The band Life in a Blender, six musicians who have played in clubs and bars around the city for 20 years, released their fifth album, ''The Heart Is a Small Balloon,'' in March. The eighth in the lineup of 14 songs is a bouncy little anthem called ''What Happened to Smith?'' about Smith Street in Carroll Gardens.</p>

        <p>Of all the whining about gentrification in Brooklyn, this may be the first time the complaints have been set to an energetic beat with a bass line, a violin interlude and backup vocals.</p>
        <p>The band Life in a Blender, six musicians who have played in clubs and bars around the city for 20 years, released their fifth album, ''The Heart Is a Small Balloon,'' in March. The eighth in the lineup of 14 songs is a bouncy little anthem called ''What Happened to Smith?'' about Smith Street in Carroll Gardens.</p>
        <p>''The voice of the song is a cranky old man complaining how the neighborhood has changed,'' explained Don Rauf, the band's guitarist, lead singer and lyricist. ''Maybe I'm the cranky old man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rauf, a square-jawed, 43-year-old education writer and editor who looks like a bookish science teacher more than a rock musician, moved to Brooklyn from the Lower East Side in 1993 in search of cheaper rent. He found it on Smith Street, along with ordinary bodegas, no-frills sandwich shops and rough-edged characters.</p>
        <p>''There were no pretensions about it,'' recalled Mr. Rauf, who is sometimes known professionally as Don Ralph.</p>
        <p>Following a familiar trajectory, though, the street was soon transformed from a downscale strip into a desirable destination. First there were a few funky cafes and restaurants. Then there were lots of them. Then, Mr. Rauf said mournfully, ''Dunkin' Donuts opened, and Starbucks, and all the things that make the street look like the Paramus Mall.''</p>
        <p>The song laments the changes, its lyrics bemoaning expensive sandwiches, goateed hipsters and escalating rent:</p>
        <p>The old gang on Sackett's closing up their blades</p>
        <p>All the social clubs are pulling down their shades</p>
        <p>Where's the five dollar hero? It's just $20 and tip.</p>
        <p>I might as well starve tonight</p>
        <p>Oh man, what happened to Smith?</p>
        <p>The song, which was the subject of an article in The Brooklyn Paper, has sparked comments on local blogs, and Mr. Rauf said that some people had accused him of overreacting. He maintains that he understands the natural course of events in the neighborhood, at the same time that he complains about the loss of its old character.</p>
        <p>''It's not that I'm yelling about Smith Street every day,'' he said. ''I'd go crazy. But you do miss what made it special.''</p>
