        <p>The Kings of the Road  Ken W. Purdy  A few black-and-white photographs. 256 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company, 1952.</p>
        <p>Few car books bear rereading. For marque histories and learned studies, a single pass usually suffices before they are shelved for reference, while coffee-table tomes often have text so thin they're better left unread.</p>
        <p>An exception to the rule is Ken W. Purdy's ''Kings of the Road,'' from 1952. In print for an amazing 17 years, it served as early education for more than a generation of enthusiasts, and it still delights today.</p>
        <p>The book covers the usual prewar icons -- Bugatti, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes-Benz and Duesenberg -- as well as Mr. Purdy's favorite Mercer Raceabout. Le Mans, the Indianapolis 500 and the Vanderbilt Cup races rate chapters, as does ''The Flying Mantuan,'' the great driver Tazio Nuvolari. A chapter on front-wheel drive puts a little-known pioneer, J. Walter Christie, on an equal footing with E. L. Cord and André Citroën; the Stanley twins share the spotlight in the chapter on steam cars.</p>
        <p>This is not a definitive history, and it has its share of errors, though many of them were conventional wisdom at publication. The author's style is plain, yet pithy. The owner of a Bugatti ''becomes its willing slave for life,'' and the Mercer's attraction ''derives from its starkness.''</p>
        <p>Copies of the book are plentiful on the used market, often inexpensive and much more satisfying than a retreaded Porsche potboiler.</p>
