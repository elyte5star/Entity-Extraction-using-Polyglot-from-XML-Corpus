        <p>Joy McAleer has had a front-row seat to the troubles of her church.</p>
        <p>It was Ms. McAleer, the 84-year-old church secretary, who opened the door on Feb. 26 to three employees of the Archdiocese of New York. They had come to close Our Lady of Vilnius, a Lithuanian parish on Broome Street and one of 21 churches that the archdiocese is shuttering in an effort to ease its fiscal situation.</p>
        <p>But whatever the financial problems, when Ms. McAleer returned to the church two months later and saw that it had been stripped of its relics and furnishings, she was aghast.</p>
        <p>''They had taken out the stained glass windows, the benches were gone, the altars gone, the wall paintings painted over,'' Ms. McAleer recalled recently at a cafe on the corner of Varick and Broome Streets.</p>
        <p>Ms. McAleer is now suing the archdiocese in Manhattan Supreme Court, and she was at the cafe to meet with Joe Pantuliano, 62, her co-plaintiff and, like her, a former church trustee. According to Sidney Baumgarten, their lawyer, the two are suing on behalf of their fellow parishioners, to reclaim their SoHo church and its contents or the proceeds of any sale of the property.</p>
        <p>The yellow brick church, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, is a testament to a time before cars choked surrounding streets. Back in 1905, when Our Lady of Vilnius was built, the surrounding neighborhood was filled with Lithuanian immigrants. (Vilnius is the country's capital.) But times have changed, and the congregation has dwindled.</p>
        <p>That decline in membership is one reason the church was closed in February, said Joseph Zwilling, an archdiocese spokesman. Another is that few Lithuanians live nearby, and a third is that Mass is no longer said in Lithuanian.</p>
        <p>The church is not for sale, Mr. Zwilling continued, and as to the removed furnishings, ''the contents of the church that could and should be preserved have been removed and placed in a storage facility for safekeeping, and possible future use in another church.'' The church's fresco was painted over, he added, to protect it from deterioration because it couldn't be removed.</p>
        <p>Even after their church was shuttered, the parishioners held out hope. Ms. McAleer has been among the 15 or so protesters who gather every Sunday near St. Patrick's Cathedral before reassembling at Our Lady of Vilnius, where they brandish their signs, eat Lithuanian rye bread, prop white crosses in the front of the church and pray for its reopening.</p>
        <p>The protesters have a prominent ally. In late April, the Lithuanian president, Valdas Adamkus, visited the Vatican, where, according to his official Internet site, www.president.lt/en /news, he asked Pope Benedict XVI to intercede to save the parish.</p>
        <p>The doors of the church are a canvas for protesters, too. Scrawled on white posters affixed to the door have been messages like ''The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing'' and ''Cardinal Egan Thou Shalt Not Steal.''</p>
