        <p>Bill Yuengling, who grew up in Westwood, spent many hours of his childhood, he says, driving around the state with his father in search of the best hot dog they could find. It was all groundwork for Hot Dog Heaven in Emerson, the shop he opened six years ago.</p>
        <p>His hot dog fans are pretty evenly divided into two camps. Some like their Sabrett's steamed ''pushcart style'' for a modest $2.09, but others go for the Thumann's deep-fried ''rippers'' for $2.79. Add 10 cents for a topping like chili, cheese, sauerkraut, red onion sauce, sautéed or raw onions, jalapenos, B&amp;G relish, hot chopped cherry peppers or sautéed onions and peppers. The Sabrett's ''all the way'' with mustard, chili and raw onion is $2.29; a Texas Thumann with the same trimmings is $2.99.</p>

        <p>Bill Yuengling, who grew up in Westwood, spent many hours of his childhood, he says, driving around the state with his father in search of the best hot dog they could find. It was all groundwork for Hot Dog Heaven in Emerson, the shop he opened six years ago.</p>
        <p>His hot dog fans are pretty evenly divided into two camps. Some like their Sabrett's steamed ''pushcart style'' for a modest $2.09, but others go for the Thumann's deep-fried ''rippers'' for $2.79. Add 10 cents for a topping like chili, cheese, sauerkraut, red onion sauce, sautéed or raw onions, jalapenos, B&amp;G relish, hot chopped cherry peppers or sautéed onions and peppers. The Sabrett's ''all the way'' with mustard, chili and raw onion is $2.29; a Texas Thumann with the same trimmings is $2.99.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yuengling's slogan is ''We're not just hot dogs,'' and each week he serves 50 pounds of pulled pork, roasted for 15 hours with his mother's recipe for barbecue sauce, which has just a hint of sweetness. A pulled pork hero is $7.29 and can be dressed up with sautéed onions and melted mozzarella. Pulled pork on a hamburger bun is $4.39.</p>
        <p>Also popular is the Philly cheese steak, chopped on the grill with peppers and onions and finished in the oven, letting the cheese melt throughout the sandwich. Mr. Yuengling uses Black Angus beef for his burgers and sandwiches. Quarter-pound burgers start at $3.49, and can be topped with cheeses and sauces. Salads, heroes, wraps, wings, fried chicken and homemade soups fill out the menu.</p>
        <p>There's a scattering of chairs and tables inside and out, with umbrellas for the al fresco diners. ''I've gained 50 pounds in the six years I've been here,'' Mr. Yuengling said. That's a lot of dogs.</p>
        <p>Hot Dog Heaven, 176 Kinderkamack Road, Emerson; (201) 261-0073. Open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
