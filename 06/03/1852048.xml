        <p>A bill introduced in the state Legislature last month would create a temporary state commission to explore the financial impact on local governments of the proposed Broadwater Energy liquefied natural gas plant in Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>The sponsors, Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Port Jefferson, and Assemblymen Marc S. Alessi, Democrat of Wading River, and Fred W. Thiele Jr., Republican of Sag Harbor, oppose the project and say too little is known about public costs for the police, firefighters and municipal services to protect a privately owned project and to be prepared for an accident or attack.</p>
        <p>The county executives and assessors of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester, state legislative leaders and the executive director of the State Office of Real Property Services would appoint the commission's 13 members.</p>
        <p>The members would hold public hearings and make findings and recommendations within a year to Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Legislature. The bill requires that recommendations include shifting costs from the governments to Broadwater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer has not taken a public position on the project. It will need state approvals to go forward. Broadwater is also seeking needed approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>
        <p>Broadwater has emphasized that the proposed location of the terminal, nine miles off Long Island and 11 miles off Connecticut, increases public safety. The company has also said it would pay to maintain its own firefighting and security personnel.</p>
        <p>John Hritcko Jr., senior vice president for Broadwater, said in an e-mail message on Wednesday that the bill was redundant because by law Broadwater was required to come up with a cost-sharing plan before the floating plant could operate. ''Safety and security costs will be borne by the project -- not local government,'' he said in the statement.</p>
