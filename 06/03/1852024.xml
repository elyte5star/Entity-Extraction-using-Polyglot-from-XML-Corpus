        <p>The final results are in, and local elections in Dobbs Ferry will remain in November.</p>
        <p>The proposal to move elections to March was defeated by 14 votes. The final tally was 793 to 779, according to the County Board of Elections officials, who released the numbers last Wednesday. Elections officials waited a week to count outstanding absentee and affidavit votes to allow time for all the absentee votes to come in.</p>
        <p>''The election will remain in November, just as it is now,'' said Carolee C. Sunderland, the election board commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mayor Joseph J. Bova, who supported moving the election date, was resigned to the result, but expressed disappointment that there wasn't greater voter participation. Only 1,566 of the village's 6,000 registered voters voted on the referendum. ''We had about the same number of signatures on the petition as the number of people who voted yes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Supporters of moving the date said local issues get lost when they are mixed in with state and federal elections, and smaller parties get poor placement on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Opponents argued that there is larger turnout when elections are held in November, with state and federal races, and less chance of having a measure pass as a result of low voter turnout.</p>
        <p>''It was quite a dramatic ending,'' said Dr. Gregg Ury, an opponent of the measure. ''But I thought the people of Dobbs Ferry indicated once again that they favor November elections where many more residents participate in the democratic process.''</p>
