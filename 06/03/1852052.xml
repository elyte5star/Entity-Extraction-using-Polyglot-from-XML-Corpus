        <p>''Duke's Comeback Season Ends Short of the Title'' (May 29) gave short shrift to the great accomplishment of the Johns Hopkins men's lacrosse team. The Blue Jays established a record by winning their ninth N.C.A.A. tournament championship.</p>
        <p>Johns Hopkins should be duly recognized even while noting the emotional aspect of the runner-up team.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>The Division I men's lacrosse championship game should have been reported as a Johns Hopkins victory first, a Duke loss second. Hopkins, by design, jumped out to the early lead, anticipating Duke's inevitable run. When Duke went on that run, Hopkins kept cool and played its game.</p>
        <p>The Johns Hopkins team came to play lacrosse, and its efforts were rewarded. End of story.</p>
