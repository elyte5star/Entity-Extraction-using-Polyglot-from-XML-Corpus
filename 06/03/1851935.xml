        <p>Earthlink, which has not had a permanent chief executive since Garry Betty died of cancer in January at the age of 49, is dangling unusual incentives before five of its top executives.</p>
        <p>Call them ''please don't leave before the new boss is chosen'' bonuses. Michael C. Lunsford, the interim president and chief executive, will collect $400,000 if he stays until May 1 and an additional $300,000 if he is still with Earthlink on Jan. 1, 2009.</p>
        <p>Four other senior executives stand to collect a total of $2.3 million if they stay on through next year or until the day the new boss fires them, whichever comes first.</p>
