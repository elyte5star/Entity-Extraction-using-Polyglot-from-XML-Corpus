      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on suit filed by residents of Katonah, NY, joined by members of Lenape Indian Nation, against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia for trying to trademark name Katonah for line of furniture and home furnishings</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''The familiar and the fancy are combined to splendid effect in the Katonah(TM) Collection,'' the people at Martha Stewart's empire tell us, pitching a $12 catalogue of furniture and home furnishings that sell for a lot more than that. The line ''showcases classic American style, accented with a touch of formal refinement,'' which presumably is how they do things in Katonah, where Ms. Stewart owns a 153-acre estate.</p>
        <p>What it showcases, actually, is a classic American spitting match, accented with a touch of formal resentment. The crass and the decorous are combined to splendid effect in this battle between residents of a well-to-do Westchester hamlet and their neighbor Ms. Stewart, who was inspired by the region's ''beautiful'' topography to register the name Katonah as a trademark for a line of home furnishings, furniture, paint and lighting products.</p>

        <p>The crass and the decorous are combined to splendid effect in a battle between residents of a well-to-do Westchester hamlet and their neighbor, Martha Stewart.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>''The familiar and the fancy are combined to splendid effect in the Katonah(TM) Collection,'' the people at Martha Stewart's empire tell us, pitching a $12 catalogue of furniture and home furnishings that sell for a lot more than that. The line ''showcases classic American style, accented with a touch of formal refinement,'' which presumably is how they do things in Katonah, where Ms. Stewart owns a 153-acre estate.</p>
        <p>What it showcases, actually, is a classic American spitting match, accented with a touch of formal resentment. The crass and the decorous are combined to splendid effect in this battle between residents of a well-to-do Westchester hamlet and their neighbor Ms. Stewart, who was inspired by the region's ''beautiful'' topography to register the name Katonah as a trademark for a line of home furnishings, furniture, paint and lighting products.</p>
        <p>And such a line it is, judging from one Web page we saw: ''Dynamic visual details give our antique-inspired pieces an entrancing sense of movement. The expansive Carriageway Landscape Dresser contains 10 drawers whose sterling silver-plated pulls are rakishly offset. It shares with the Carriageway Tall Dresser carved bracket legs and a lovely upswept veneer. The same veneer lends vibrancy to the stately crown molding and arches of the Carriageway Armoire.''</p>
        <p>But the citizens of Katonah aren't complaining about gibbering ad copy. What they don't like is having their village's identity stolen by a brand name, and they've been raising money to fight Ms. Stewart in court. The battle has been simmering since the beginning of the year and has now been joined by members of an American Indian tribe, the Ramapough Lenape Nation, who resent what they consider Ms. Stewart's exploitation of their 17th-century ancestor Chief Katonah.</p>
        <p>If exploitation it is, Ms. Stewart is hardly an innovator. America is a bristling forest of brand names that harness history and romance to the engines of commerce. American Indians are particular targets -- all those Pontiacs and Cherokees -- but towns and cities are not exempt, as anyone who eats cream cheese knows.</p>
        <p>It seems unlikely that Katonah (the hamlet) will either vanquish or be much harmed by Katonah (the brand). People who live there and want to get on with life may end up just having to avoid certain magazines, TV programs and furniture departments. They can console themselves with knowing what a great divide separates their lives from those of people like Ms. Stewart, who made and therefore must inhabit a sprawling, meticulously tended universe of perfected quasi-reality, in which everything is on display and everything is for sale.</p>
        <p>They might also consider moving to a place like Yonkers or Jersey City, which may never have to worry about having their identities appropriated by people hawking Chippendale chinoiserie.</p>
