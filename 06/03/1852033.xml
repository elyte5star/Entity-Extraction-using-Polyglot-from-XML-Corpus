        <p>In a preview of the themes he is likely to emphasize in a presidential campaign, Fred D. Thompson tossed some red meat to Republicans here Saturday night, assailing the immigration bill in Congress and warning of a mushroom cloud he said radicals around the world were waiting to see rise over the United States.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Thompson spoke in a soft Southern cadence, weaving in his biography as a homespun, small-town lawyer with a belief in basic principles and a desire to bring people together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, 64, a former senator from Tennessee, has all but announced that he will be announcing his candidacy for president, probably within several weeks. He filed preliminary papers on Friday that allow him to start raising money and hiring staff.</p>
        <p>He did not directly address his intentions here Saturday, but he made several allusions about the country needing new leadership and said at one point in his 35-minute speech, ''We're going to cut some new ground over the next year or so.''</p>
        <p>In a brief interview afterward, he said he was just ''testing the waters,'' but added, ''The waters feel pretty warm, to tell you the truth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson's appearance at the event, a previously scheduled fund-raising dinner for the Virginia Republican Party, was his first since he and his supporters indicated a few days ago that he was preparing to enter the race. His supporters say he can fill what they see as a void for a true conservative who can also get elected.</p>
        <p>The speech was both a call to arms and a declaration to conservatives that he is one of them. Mr. Thompson paid homage to Barry Goldwater as his political inspiration. He denounced the so-called death tax. He took a swipe at Democrats for what he said was hanging out a ''surrender'' sign in the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Believe it or not, we still have many friends around the world,'' Mr. Thompson said. But he said those friends needed convincing ''that this is a battle between the forces of civilization and the forces of evil and we've got to choose sides.''</p>
        <p>He was short on specifics, offering instead a broad conservative approach toward smaller government, lower taxes and a bigger defense budget.</p>
        <p>It was his views on immigration that brought the diners to their feet with sustained applause.</p>
        <p>''You've got to secure the border first before you do anything else,'' he said, adding, ''This is our home, and we get to decide who comes into our home.''</p>
        <p>Supporters have said Mr. Thompson's plan is to become the plausible alternative to the 10 Republicans who are already running for president but have failed to excite the broad base of conservatives who dominate the party's primaries. At the same time, he wants to appear nonthreatening to general-election voters.</p>
        <p>The Republican candidates include Senator John McCain of Arizona, long a Thompson ally, who helped draw up the immigration bill currently under debate in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, who spent eight years in the Senate, took several jabs at Washington, where he still lives. Referring to his acting career, he said he had left the Senate because ''after eight years in Washington, I longed for the realism and sincerity of Hollywood.''</p>
