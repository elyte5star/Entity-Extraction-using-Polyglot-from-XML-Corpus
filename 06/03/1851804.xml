        <p>With an unusually high number of state lawmakers retiring this year, voters in the primary election on Tuesday will find more contested races than in the past. Twelve state senators are retiring, and 13 members of the Assembly are forgoing their seats to run for the Senate.</p>
        <p>There are some hotly contested primaries in Hudson, Bergen and Sussex Counties. Among the most closely watched contests are a handful of legislative races in Essex County, where Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark has endorsed three candidates who are vying for seats held by longtime incumbents.</p>
        <p>Senator Ronald L. Rice, a Democrat, for example, is being challenged by D. Bilal Beasley, a county freeholder endorsed by Mr. Booker. Mr. Rice lost to Mr. Booker in the mayor's race in 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rice said he expected voters to support him based on his record of service. ''The other side is about money and power, and that's obvious for most people,'' he said. Mr. Booker could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Ingrid W. Reed, a political analyst at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said that Mr. Booker's endorsement of candidates showed that he was taking a larger role in state politics. ''The real winner or loser in this primary may be Cory Booker for taking a real chance in this race,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the Essex County decisions, the large number of politicians who are retiring signals a generational shift in state politics, Ms. Reed said. ''There will be new faces in the Legislature, but there will also be new faces in the leadership, and the competition for leadership positions will grow,'' she said.</p>
