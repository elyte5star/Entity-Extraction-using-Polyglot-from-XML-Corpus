        <p>MTV Movie Treasure  Capt. Jack Sparrow fared well when the MTV Movie Awards were handed out on Sunday in Universal City, Calif., The Associated Press reported. ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' the second of three ''Pirates'' films, was named the best movie of 2006, and Johnny Depp, right, was named best actor for his portrayal of Captain Sparrow. Sacha Baron Cohen earned prizes for best kiss for his smooch with Will Ferrell in ''Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'' and for comedic performance for his portrayal of Borat Sagdiyev in ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.'' Mike Myers won the MTV Generation Award. Jack Nicholson won the Golden Popcorn trophy for best villain for his portrayal of a mobster in ''The Departed.''</p>
        <p>Odds Against Harry Potter  British bookmakers are so certain that Harry Potter will die in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' that they have stopped taking bets on his fate, Bloomberg News reported yesterday. ''Every penny was on Harry dying, and it became untenable,'' said Rupert Adams, a spokesman for the London-based bookmaker William Hill. ''People are obsessed about this book.'' Instead, bookmakers will accept wagers on the identity of the killer. Lord Voldemort, who dispatched Harry's parents, is the 2-to-1 favorite at William Hill, followed by the Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape at 5 to 2. ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' above, which J. K. Rowling has said is the final novel in the series, goes on sale July 21.</p>
        <p>Historic Letters Surface In Swiss Laundry Room  A filing cabinet in a Swiss laundry room has yielded a trove of nearly 1,000 letters written by Napoleon, Churchill, Peter the Great, Gandhi, Pushkin, John Donne and Queen Elizabeth I, among others, Reuters reported yesterday. Spanning more than half a millennium and ranging across art, science, literature and philosophy, the letters were amassed in more than 30 years of collecting by a wealthy Austrian banker and are to be auctioned by Christie's in London on July 3, when they are expected to fetch as much as $4.6 million. The collector, Albin Schram, kept them in an old metal filing cabinet in the laundry room of his villa in Lausanne. When he died in 2005, his family scarcely knew they were there. One of the rarest letters was written by an apologetic Napoleon on the morning after a furious argument with his wife, Josephine. In a spidery scrawl full of corrections and crossings out, Napoleon wrote, ''I send you three kisses -- one on your heart, one on your mouth and one on your eyes.''</p>
        <p>Rain Disrupts 'Romeo'  Recent rains have washed out the first preview of the Public Theater's presentation of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Originally scheduled for tonight, the first preview will take place tomorrow. Performances continue through July 8.  Ethan Coen, below, whose credits as a filmmaker include ''Blood Simple,'' ''Raising Arizona,'' ''Fargo'' and ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?,'' will turn up as a playwright with ''Three Short Plays by Ethan Coen'' in the fall season on the Atlantic Theater Company's Stage 2. The company's main stage season includes the world premiere of ''Trumpery'' by Peter Parnell (who adapted John Irving's ''Cider House Rules'' for the stage); the world premiere of ''Parlour Song'' by the British playwright Jez Butterworth (''Mojo''); the New York premiere of ''Port Authority'' by Conor McPherson (''Shining City''); and the world premiere of ''Scarcity'' by Lucy Thurber (''Bottom of the World'').</p>
        <p>Footnotes  ICM Artists, the classical music management agency, is changing its name to Opus 3 Artists and moving into new offices next month at Park Avenue South and 32nd Street in Manhattan. The moves follow the division's purchase from International Creative Management by managers and Newsweb, a Chicago printing and media company.  Frank Price, the former chairman and chief executive of Columbia Pictures, and Jeff Zucker, president and chief executive of NBC Universal, have been elected to the board of the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens.  Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, citing a lack of suitable evidence, has decided not to charge Hugh Grant, the actor, in connection with a photographer's complaint that Mr. Grant, 46, threw a container of beans and kicked at him, Reuters reported.  The New York Philharmonic and Credit Suisse announced a three-year agreement yesterday to make the bank the first and sole global sponsor of the orchestra. Starting Sept. 1, Credit Suisse will be named in connection with all events in New York, around the United States and abroad. Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
