        <p>I'm an independent film producer based in both New York City and Hollywood. I've only been at this for a few years. And I have to say that at the beginning, it was tough.

        <p>This is a business in which first impressions are a huge factor in determining whether you will get a script or book or work with a certain writer or director. You want to meet these people face to face so they can see that you are passionate about your work and their work. You never want to tell a colleague that you can't get to some destination for that all-important meeting.</p>

        <p>I'm an independent film producer based in both New York City and Hollywood. I've only been at this for a few years. And I have to say that at the beginning, it was tough. In my business, you have to be able to meet with agents, writers and directors at a moment's notice. If you don't, you stand the chance of losing out on the rights to a great story.</p>
        <p>This is a business in which first impressions are a huge factor in determining whether you will get a script or book or work with a certain writer or director. You want to meet these people face to face so they can see that you are passionate about your work and their work. You never want to tell a colleague that you can't get to some destination for that all-important meeting.</p>
        <p>But when my partner and I started our company, Frank &amp; Wally Films, back in 2003, we were fresh out of Michigan law school and strapped for cash. We could barely afford to buy drinks when we schmoozed at the Chateau Marmont, let alone fly from Hollywood to New York or Paris or Sydney on a moment's notice.</p>
        <p>So I decided to work the system. My goal was to get to these meetings by attaining frequent-flier platinum status on Northwest Airlines.</p>
        <p>A sane person might take two nonstops to go from one coast to the other and back again. I would book a seven-leg itinerary that took me from LaGuardia to Atlanta, on to Salt Lake City, then Las Vegas, and finally into Burbank and back again through Houston, Minneapolis, Cleveland and Newark. A normal flight from New York to Los Angeles takes about five hours (four and a half in reverse). I would regularly be in the air for two or three times that long.</p>
        <p>The obvious benefit of this mileage madness was collecting about 7,000 to 9,000 miles, rather than the typical 5,000 miles accrued for a coast-to-coast round trip. It took me only about seven months to rack up the holy grail of the 75,000 miles I needed to become a platinum person.</p>
        <p>But I found myself taking the long way even after I hit the goal. And sometimes I still take the most circuitous route I can book. I'm addicted to the freedom a stockpile of reward miles affords. I can actually say to a writer, ''I'll be out there on the next plane,'' and mean it. Or I can give the miles to a writer or director to come see us.</p>
        <p>It's also amazing how many scripts or books I can read in sometimes up to 12 hours of flight time. No one talks to me since I usually wear headphones, even when I'm not listening to anything.</p>
        <p>All of this solitary time can make me feel very magnanimous by the time I land. If you ever happen to see a script in the seatback slot in front of you, consider it a gift from me. I've left a lot of scripts that didn't meet our criteria for production for the next passenger to peruse.</p>
        <p>So if you see a fat wad of paper stuck between the in-flight magazine and last month's GQ, take some time to give it a read. Maybe it will spark your creativity. Who knows? I could wind up as your producer.</p>
