        <p>Re ''Agent at Border, Aware of Alert, Did Not Detain Man Who Has TB'' (front page, June 1):</p>
        <p>Perhaps one good outcome of this ordeal is a new appreciation of why we, as a nation, need to know and care about public health threats brewing around the globe -- before they cross our borders.</p>
        <p>We had a scare with the avian flu, but this tuberculosis case has brought the issue down to a very personal level.</p>
        <p>Will this be the watershed event that will change our apathy into action?</p>
        <p>Susan Moses  Boston, June 1, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is deputy director of the Center for Health Communication at Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a physician and a woman of ethnic origin, I am disturbed that Andrew Speaker, the man with a dangerous form of tuberculosis, feels that an apology is acceptable. But that is a decision that he and his family will obviously have to live with.</p>
        <p>I pose the following scenario and wonder how different the response would be if the patient in question were a young male of Islamic origin?</p>
        <p>Kavita K. Patel, M.D.  Santa Monica, Calif., June 1, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The border agent let Andrew Speaker pass, despite knowing that he was being sought by health authorities, on the grounds that he did not look sick.</p>
        <p>Does that mean that in a parallel case, someone who does not look like a terrorist will also be allowed entry?</p>
