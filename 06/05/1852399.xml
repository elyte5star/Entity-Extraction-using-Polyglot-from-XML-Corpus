        <p>Support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped to its lowest since he took office in September, hovering at 30 percent in a poll by the national daily Asahi Shimbun. Other polls indicated a similar slide in Mr. Abe's approval ratings, which have suffered from the recent suicide of his scandal-tainted agricultural minister and from the government's mishandling of pension records. The fall increased the possibility that his governing Liberal Democratic Party might lose seats in July's upper house election; an outright defeat could spur calls for him to step down as party leader and prime minister.</p>
