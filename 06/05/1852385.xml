        <p>Senator Craig Thomas, a three-term Republican from Wyoming, died Monday evening, just hours after his staff reported that the treatment he was receiving for leukemia was no longer working. He was 74.</p>
        <p>Under Wyoming's election laws, the state Republican Party will nominate three people to be his successor. The final choice will be made by the state's governor, David Freudenthal, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Because the seat will remain in Republican control, the balance of power in the Senate will not shift, a prospect that shook up Capitol Hill when Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, had a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 13.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas's family issued a statement saying he died Monday evening at National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where he had been receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas announced that he had just been given the leukemia diagnosis two days after the 2006 election, in which he was elected with 70 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Raised on a ranch near Cody, Wyo., Mr. Thomas worked with the Wyoming Farm Bureau and the Wyoming Rural Electric Association before entering politics in the state Legislature.</p>
        <p>He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1989 in a special election to replace Dick Cheney, who had been appointed secretary of defense. He was first elected to the Senate in 1994.</p>
        <p>Senator Thomas, a conservative who could almost always be counted on to vote with the Republican leadership, served on the national parks subcommittee, an assignment that was a good fit for a lawmaker whose state was home to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.</p>
        <p>Whether the issue was snow-mobiling, wildlife management or timber rights, he believed that policy for parklands should be set Westerners, not by ''East Coast liberals.''</p>
        <p>When Senator Johnson fell ill last year, there was speculation that the Democrats could lose the two-vote margin by which they had just won control of the Senate a month earlier. But he is preparing to return to the Senate soon.</p>
