        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Redolence of Spring? Call It Essence of Nitrogen'' (Basics, May 29): Nitrogen is indeed one of a handful of elements that take center stage in the dance of life on earth. That makes it all the more disturbing that human activities are upsetting the earth's natural nitrogen cycle. The consequences range from water pollution and lake eutrophication to increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide. Addressing the nitrogen pollution problem will involve difficult choices and innovative solutions, but we ignore the problem at our own peril.</p>
