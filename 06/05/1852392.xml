        <p>Practice was just under way for the Detroit Shock, defending champion of the Women's National Basketball Association, and Coach Bill Laimbeer was not entirely happy with the conditioning drills. Few people will talk back to a man who is 6 feet 11 inches and always considers himself the smartest person in the room. This does not include Laimbeer's assistant, Rick Mahorn, who is only an inch shorter and is often the funniest person in the room.</p>
        <p>''Zip it,'' Mahorn barked at Laimbeer's instructions on this day in late May, drawing his fingers across his own lips.</p>
        <p>''I. ...''</p>
        <p>''Zip it.''</p>
        <p>Laimbeer said, ''I can fine, suspend or fire you.''</p>
        <p>Mahorn shot back, ''I'll walk out right now, and there'll be a revolution.''</p>
        <p>Smiles creased their faces. No blood, no foul.</p>
        <p>The calendar has long turned the playing pages on Laimbeer, 50, who won N.B.A. titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990, and Mahorn, 48, who was on that first championship team. They now coach the daughter of one of their adversaries, Karl Malone. But if these aging Bad Boys have grown soft in the waist, they have lost nothing of the zinging sarcasm that informs their personalities and has made the Shock one of the most unorthodox and entertaining teams in organized sports.</p>
        <p>The Bad Boys now coach the Bad Girls, who are aggressive in a way that Pistons fans of the late 1980s would find familiar -- scuffling and relentless on defense, voracious on the boards. [Detroit is 4-0 heading into a game against the Liberty in New York on Friday.]</p>
        <p>''Some players say we intimidate them, we're bullies,'' said forward Cheryl Ford, the league's career rebounding leader and Malone's daughter. ''We can't help it if we're bigger and stronger than everybody else.''</p>
        <p>In guiding the Shock to W.N.B.A. titles in 2003 and 2006 as the coach and general manager, Laimbeer has created a perpetual locker-room ambience. The idea is to deflate cliques and to let players be themselves while channeling their inner Bad Girls. Shock practices are full of mocking, teasing and casual profanity. Even the names of some inbounds plays are not suitable for children under 17. As long as it is not personal, anyone can say anything to anybody.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't bother us that our players have an edge to them,'' Laimbeer said.</p>
        <p>''Functionally dysfunctional,'' is how the team spokesman John Maxwell jokingly refers to the Shock. In this environment, the versatile forward Swin Cash is called Crackhead by Mahorn for what he perceives as her occasional aimlessness. Fair game are Laimbeer's style of walking (''On his toes, like the Flintstones,'' guard Elaine Powell said.) and his favored wardrobe of short-shorts and boating shirts (''One of his pants are so tight they look like leg warmers,'' Cash said).</p>
        <p>During the preseason, guard Shannon Johnson had a stomach virus and pulled a blanket over her head to take a nap in the airport in Dallas. Big mistake. When she awakened, Mahorn and others had thrown a few bucks into a change cup and Johnson's teammates had fashioned signs that said, ''Will Shoot for Food'' and ''War Veteran -- AWOL.''</p>
        <p>At practice May 29, Laimbeer was seeking to name an inbounds play. Essentially, he was trying to get his players -- especially Cash -- to yell something outrageous or raunchy. This play, he wanted to call ''Yo' Mama.'' Finally, Laimbeer settled on something vulgar, but Cash, as always, refused to say anything crude.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to the dark side,'' she told him.</p>
        <p>This informal style carries its risks. It can produce a thriving atmosphere for winning teams, but can become corrosive on losing teams or during the heat of a game. Last season, Laimbeer grew dissatisfied at times with Cash's intensity, and the tension between them played out on national television. During the W.N.B.A. championship series, the usually accessible Laimbeer refused any longer to a wear a microphone on the bench and banned ESPN's cameras from Detroit's locker room.</p>
        <p>His generally laid-back approach aside, Laimbeer is hypercompetitive and deadly serious about basketball. His joking can be offset by withering candor.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, Ivory Latta played in the women's Final Four with North Carolina. She was an all-American point guard, the 2005-6 national player of the year. Now she is just another W.N.B.A. rookie, buried deep on the bench.</p>
        <p>''She won't play for us this year,'' Laimbeer said bluntly.</p>
        <p>He stopped practice at one point and told Latta, ''You gotta shoot the ball. You can't shoot, you can't play.''</p>
        <p>Guard Katie Smith, the W.N.B.A.'s leading career scorer, said that she appreciated Laimbeer because ''he pulled no punches and blew no smoke.'' But his style can be jarring for newcomers. Ebullient in college, Latta seemed reticent now. After practice, Laimbeer sat her down and told her that her coaches and teammates still believed in her.</p>
        <p>While he can be abrasive, he also seems to have a sincere connection with his players. Perhaps this is because Laimbeer was not a player of great skill himself, succeeding as much on resolve as talent. He keeps practices exacting but short. He has switched practice times to accommodate Cash's N.B.A. television commentary. And he found a condominium for Smith that would accept her oversized dog. During a league break for the 2004 Olympics, he took his entire team fishing.</p>
        <p>''If you don't know Bill, you think he's the biggest jerk walking,'' Cash said. ''I can see past it all. He played. He knows the game. He's competitive and he wants to win. He'll go to war with you every day.''</p>
        <p>Smiling, Cash added: ''I like him. Do I think he's dysfunctional? Yes. But is he a heck of a coach? Yes.''</p>
        <p>Experience and Edge</p>
        <p>On May 30, the morning of a home game against Washington, the Shock watched videotape of the Mystics. Joking from the previous day was gone. Cellphones were turned off in the locker room, lest the players draw fines. Laimbeer grew impatient when the remote control for the videotape machine balked. And he glared in annoyance when the team trainer kept going in and out of the door.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Reeve, another Shock assistant, ran through the scouting report on Washington.</p>
        <p>''I really value their pro experience,'' Reeve said later of Laimbeer and Mahorn. ''Bill is at all times three steps ahead of everybody in his thinking. Rick's nuances for playing defense, that's what he's good at. He really breaks it down.''</p>
        <p>As Cash did a day earlier, Reeve mentioned ''the dark side.''</p>
        <p>''It's the edge, a place a lot of women don't have,'' Reeve said of Laimbeer. ''We have competitive sides, but he brings you to that edge, competing with a sense of urgency, all out.''</p>
        <p>Washington was winless and vulnerable but desperate, Laimbeer said during the videotape session. If the Mystics kept resorting to moving screens, he offered a suggestion from the Bad Boy playbook: ''Hit them in the biceps with an elbow. That'll stop it.''</p>
        <p>On the court for the morning shootaround, the mood lightened. Latta had taken a hit in the face at a recent practice, and the coaches joked about her nose. ''Y'all better leave her alone,'' Ford said. ''Y'all already made her cry four or five times.''</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry,'' Mahorn said sheepishly.</p>
        <p>Laimbeer removed three $20 bills from his wallet and let them flutter to the court at the center circle. The team split into two groups for a final shooting drill; the winning group would keep the money for a party fund. For Laimbeer, everything is a competition. He insists he can beat all of his players at H-O-R-S-E and everybody but Smith at shooting free throws. On May 19, his 50th birthday, he took the team to a piano bar and sang ''Piano Man'' before a crowd of 200.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a good singer, but I'm not afraid,'' Laimbeer said.</p>
        <p>The Love of Competition</p>
        <p>Upon retiring from the Pistons in 1993 after 14 N.B.A. seasons, Laimbeer operated a company that made corrugated boxes. But he struggled to motivate workers on hourly wages. ''Very frustrating,'' he said. And so, in 2002, yearning for competition, he joined the Shock, taking over an 0-10 team in midseason. A season later, Detroit became the W.N.B.A. champion.</p>
        <p>[''Bill was coaching when he was playing,'' said Isiah Thomas, the coach and president of the Knicks and a former Pistons teammate of Laimbeer's. ''Chuck Daly put a lot of trust in us. We had guys on the floor telling each other what to do, putting together game plans. Bill understands offensive and defensive concepts as well as anyone.'']</p>
        <p>When someone expresses surprise that Laimbeer is coaching women, he answers: ''These are professional athletes. They are at the top of the world in what they do.''</p>
        <p>Women play a fundamentally sound game and listen better than men, he said. Still, a coach runs his course with any team.</p>
        <p>''You grind on the players; they grind on you,'' Laimbeer said. At some point, he said, he would like to coach in the N.B.A., although a certain question hangs like a last-second shot: Would his forceful personality be accepted?</p>
        <p>''I'm a championship coach,'' Laimbeer said. ''I win, I demand, I hold people accountable. My job is to say what everybody else is thinking but is afraid to say. Some people don't like that. That's too bad.''</p>
        <p>He says his style would work in the N.B.A., on his terms. Reflecting upon the Larry Brown fiasco with the Knicks, Daly said, Thomas told him, ''I should have hired Laimbeer; he's so thick-skinned.''</p>
        <p>First things first. Laimbeer's aim now is a third W.N.B.A. title. An hour before the game against the Mystics, Mahorn instructed the reserve center Katie Feenstra how to dribble with her fingers instead of her palm. Then the starting center Kara Braxton walked past, and Mahorn uttered words he surely never said during his playing career: ''Your makeup's coming off.''</p>
        <p>As Mahorn sat on the scorer's table, Ford and forward Plenette Pierson flanked him in a pregame ritual. When he played with the Washington Bullets, Mahorn and Jeff Ruland were known as McFilthy and McNasty. Now the Shock players call him Huggy Bear.</p>
        <p>He reminded Ford and Pierson that the Mystics post player Nakia Sanford seldom passed the ball. ''She wouldn't pass the orange juice at breakfast,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then he grew introspective. His mother, Alice Mahorn, who passed away 15 years earlier, would have been 71 on this day, he told the players. He considered her his mother, his father, his best friend. She was buried in Hartford, but he had not been to visit her grave. ''She's not there,'' Mahorn said, then pointed to his chest. ''She's in here.''</p>
        <p>Once in the locker room, Laimbeer told the Shock that the Mystics lacked size and played indifferent defense. ''Run them into the ground,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Complaining and Cajoling</p>
        <p>The game started clumsily for Detroit. The Shock turned the ball over repeatedly and allowed Washington a volley of offensive rebounds. Laimbeer kept complaining that the Mystics' guards were carrying the ball.</p>
        <p>He paced the sideline in his sports coat, talking constantly to the referees. When he felt aggrieved, he pirouetted in disbelief or jammed his thumbs inside his belt. Sometimes, he leaned in an odd way as he walked back to the bench, as if trying to get out of the rain.</p>
        <p>Maxwell, the team spokesman, laughed at courtside and said: ''He ought to make more money. Not only does he coach, but he refs, too.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, Laimbeer told Latta that he might play her early against Washington's zone. It might boost her confidence. Late in the first half, she entered and made a 3-pointer. Her first career basket put the Shock ahead, 40-31. Laimbeer pumped his fist.</p>
        <p>At halftime, Detroit led, 45-36, but Laimbeer said the 9-point lead could have been 15 or 20. Washington had seven offensive rebounds, he said, glancing at the stat sheet: ''That's unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>Then, as Laimbeer stood in the middle of the locker room, he noticed that Ford and Powell were giggling.</p>
        <p>''What are you looking at?'' he said. ''Oh, my zipper's down.''</p>
        <p>Mahorn burst out laughing.</p>
        <p>When a more serious mood returned, Laimbeer gave final instructions: Stop the turnovers and the lackadaisical rebounding. ''Don't let them back in it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The game broke open by 15 points in the third quarter, then Laimbeer drew a technical when he complained that Washington guard Nikki Blue was the W.N.B.A.'s worst offender at carrying the ball ''and everybody knows it.''</p>
        <p>The Mystics drew to 66-59, but faded again in the fourth period as Detroit won, 94-79. Just before the buzzer, Latta sank another 3-pointer. In the victorious locker room, Laimbeer chided his players about their 24 turnovers, saying there had been ''a lot of sloppy, stupid ones, right Cash?''</p>
        <p>''That can't happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Detroit had won and Latta had scored her first two professional baskets. Many teams would have just run out the clock at the end, Laimbeer told Latta. And then, when he seemed to be scolding her, he added: ''We don't do that. Reserve players, get yours. If they stop playing, cram it down their throats.''</p>
        <p>Then he gathered the team for a celebratory huddle.</p>
        <p>''Come on, Crack,'' Laimbeer said to Cash.</p>
        <p>She had delivered 21 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists, but Mahorn remembered only some awkward move of hers and shouted, ''That was a crackhead shot.''</p>
        <p>A smile fixed on her face, Cash mentioned the river that flowed through her hometown, McKeesport, Pa.</p>
        <p>''Y'all are going to find Bill floating in the Youghiogheny,'' she said.</p>
