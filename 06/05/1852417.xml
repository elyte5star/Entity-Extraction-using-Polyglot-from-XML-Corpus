        <p>Because of an editing error, the Religion Journal column on Saturday, about Web sites that attract Mormons who have left the faith or are questioning it, misattributed an observation about the role of the family in Mormon life. It was Philip L. Barlow, who will lead a Mormon studies program at Utah State University -- not Jeff Ricks, executive manager of the Post-Mormon Community -- who made the points that the family role ''is in-built into the theology'' and that because the family is conceived of as eternal, a wayward Mormon is ''threatening to that family unit for all eternity.''</p>
