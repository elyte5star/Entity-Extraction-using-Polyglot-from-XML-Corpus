        <p>Rescue efforts continued in southwestern Yunnan Province as roughly 180,000 people were evacuated from their homes after a Sunday morning earthquake that registered a magnitude 6.4 killed at least three people and injured more than 300, according to state news media. More than 1,000 aftershocks have rattled the nerves of residents in the city of Pu'er, in a mountainous region of Yunnan. Roughly 2,000 soldiers and rescue workers are at the scene, and evacuees are living in tents or public buildings.</p>
