        <p>Tonight it will be the Republicans' turn to debate in New Hampshire, and two issues are likely to figure prominently: immigration and terrorism threats, particularly the reported plot to blow up fuel lines at Kennedy International Airport.</p>
        <p>Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, has already incorporated the plot into his stump speech. On Saturday, after three people were arrested in connection with it, he told reporters in Florida that it served as a reminder that ''we're at war.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has sometimes been accused of fear-mongering. But the airport example flows seamlessly into his message, which is that evildoers are out to kill vast numbers of Americans, as they did on Sept. 11, and that he would keep the country safe.</p>
        <p>Certainly it reinforces his argument against the Democrats, particularly former Senator John Edwards, who reiterated at the Democratic debate on Sunday that the phrase ''war on terror'' was a political slogan used by President Bush to justify questionable actions, not a real plan.</p>
        <p>But what will Mr. Giuliani make of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's comments? She did not agree with Mr. Edwards, adding, ''I believe we are safer than we were'' before Sept. 11, an off-script sentiment for Democrats.</p>
        <p>The 7 p.m. debate, to be broadcast on CNN, will give Senator John McCain of Arizona and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, the opportunity to confront each other on the immigration bill after a week of veiled swipes.</p>
