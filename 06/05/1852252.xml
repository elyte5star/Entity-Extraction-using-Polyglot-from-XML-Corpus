        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) THE 2007 ALMA AWARDS -- Eva Longoria, left, is host of this ceremony honoring Latino achievement in the United States in film, television and music. Nominees include Gael García Bernal, Jesse Garcia, Cameron Diaz, Eva Mendes, Alfonso Cuarón, ''Babel,'' ''Ugly Betty'' and ''Quinceañera.'' Jessica Alba, Andy Garcia, George Lopez, Mario Lopez and Ms. Mendes are scheduled to appear; Mr. Lopez will be honored for special achievement in television; Los Lobos will receive the Pioneer in Music award. And Prince will perform.</p>
        <p>4 P.M. (ABC) THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW -- Cormac McCarthy gives a rare interview, following the selection of ''The Road,'' his 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, for Oprah's Book Club.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (BBC America) MI-5 -- Fans can breathe a sigh of relief: After a disappointing season on A&amp;E, this spy series, known as ''Spooks'' in Britain, has been picked up by BBC America. It moves into its new home with back-to-back episodes that examine, at 8, a string of bombings that could be the work of an anti-abortion terrorist and, at 9, the owner of a waste-management company who may be provoking race riots. The cast includes Matthew Macfadyen, above center, as Tom Quinn, senior case officer of the counterintelligence unit Section B, and Keeley Hawes, above left, and David Oyelowo, above right, as Zoe Reynolds and Danny Hunter, Quinn's nearly untouchable subordinates.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) ON THE LOT -- This competition series moves to Tuesdays as network executives try to give its flagging ratings a boost by condensing its competition and results segments into a single, hourlong episode each week. Tonight five of the would-be filmmakers screen their movies.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) AMERICA'S GOT TALENT -- A new crop of performers put their generally distinctive, if not always prodigious, talents on display for a $1 million jackpot in the second season of this competition series. Sharon Osbourne joins David Hasselhoff and Piers Morgan as judges. Jerry Springer assumes the role of host. Chairs could fly.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Bravo) KATHY GRIFFIN -- Ms. Griffin, who almost seems to relish life at the bottom of the Hollywood barrel, skewers a few celebrities -- Lindsay Lohan and Ann Coulter among them -- in this special before beginning the third season of ''Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List'' at 10.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. (NBC) THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO -- George Clooney talks about his latest stint as Danny Ocean in ''Ocean's 13,'' opening Friday; musical guests are Rihanna, the R&amp;B chanteuse, and the Zimmers, a band of British oldsters whose members include 90-year-old Alf and 100-year-old Buster.</p>
