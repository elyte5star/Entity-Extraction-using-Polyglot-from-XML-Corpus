        <p>An article on May 22 about a delay in adding specially equipped computerized train cars to the crowded L subway line misstated the overall growth in subway ridership from 1995 to 2006. It rose 37 percent, not 46 percent. The article also referred incorrectly to the ridership at the Bedford Avenue station in Brooklyn during the same period. Although ridership at Bedford increased significantly, it did not rise 139 percent. (It is not possible to compare total ridership at individual stations from 1995 to 2006 because in 1998 New York City Transit changed the way it counts students who ride the subway at no cost. Excluding students, ridership at Bedford Avenue increased 131 percent from 1995 to 2006.)</p>
