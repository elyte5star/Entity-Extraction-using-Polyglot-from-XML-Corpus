        <p>New York magazine's longtime classical music critic, Peter G. Davis, will be leaving the publication. Mr. Davis, who had been at New York for 26 years, said yesterday he was asked to sign an ''agreement of separation'' because the magazine decided it no longer needed a full-time classical music critic. ''It's euphemistic for being fired,'' he said. A spokeswoman for the magazine, Serena Torrey, said she could not comment on the terms of his departure or whether he would be replaced. ''We do plan to continue robust classical music coverage and criticism,'' she said.</p>
