        <p>Dressed in his signature pirate outfit, bright blue bandanna clinging to his sweaty brow, Rafael Nadal won his fourth-round match Monday at the French Open, defeating Lleyton Hewitt, 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (5).</p>
        <p>The victory moved him one step closer to his third consecutive title at Roland Garros. This is the first time in his three years here that he has reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set.</p>

        <p>Rafael Nadal, the two-time defending champion, is cruising through the French Open and will now face countryman and former champion Carlos Moya in the quarterfinals.</p>

        <p>Dressed in his signature pirate outfit, bright blue bandanna clinging to his sweaty brow, Rafael Nadal won his fourth-round match Monday at the French Open, defeating Lleyton Hewitt, 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (5).</p>
        <p>The victory moved him one step closer to his third consecutive title at Roland Garros. This is the first time in his three years here that he has reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set.</p>
        <p>The victory also means that Nadal, seeded second, will play his mentor and fellow Majorcan, the 30-year-old Carlos Moyá, in the quarterfinals. Moyá, the 23rd seed, was the 1998 French Open winner.</p>
        <p>Until now, their only competition at Roland Garros has been PlayStation soccer matches. But with joysticks in hand, instead of rackets, those matches have been fiery.</p>
        <p>''You get so nervous, like if it was a tennis match,'' Moyá said of the nightly video-game matchups. ''But it's good to have some fun. There's a lot of pressure here, and it's a way not to think about tennis.''</p>
        <p>Nadal wrote about those matches on his blog, saying Moyá was ''quite good and assertive'' in those games. He added that the loser was often forced to do push-ups.</p>
        <p>Each was assertive on the court Monday, with Nadal, wearing his usual sleeveless shirt and cropped black pants, having to work extra hard in his match.</p>
        <p>Hewitt, seeded 14th, was overwhelmed by Nadal's forehands and the spins he put on them, and he seemed helpless in the first two sets. But Hewitt did not let go of the third set without a struggle. His forehands did him in. At crucial points, several of them should have been easy winners, but they smacked into the net instead.</p>
        <p>His final forehand also landed in the net. Later, he said the sun had blinded him.</p>
        <p>''He moves so well on his side of the court on this surface that you feel like you've got to hit perfect shots against him,'' Hewitt said, adding: ''Sometimes he is a different player when it gets a little bit tighter. If he's 6-3, 6-1 up, he's all guns blazing and going for every shot. If you can get that tight situation, then it's a different ballgame.''</p>
        <p>Moyá had a few of those tight situations in his 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-5 victory against Jonas Bjorkman, a meeting of veterans whose combined age was 65. Through it, he never felt old, Moyá said, although he has lost some of his explosiveness.</p>
        <p>Against the 35-year-old Bjorkman, Moyá lunged after shots. He leaped to return serves. He scurried every which way on the red clay, as if it were 1998, the year he defeated Alex Corretja, another Spaniard, in the final. Nadal, who turned 21 on Sunday, was only 12 when Moyá hoisted that trophy.</p>
        <p>''I still remember when I was the youngest guy in the draw, and now I became the oldest,'' said Moyá, who is the oldest player left in the men's draw. ''The time passed so fast.''</p>
        <p>While Moyá looked spry in his match, Bjorkman did not. He had played two five-set matches at this tournament; he has also advanced to the fourth round in the doubles competition, in which he and Max Mirnyi are seeded second. He was the oldest player in the men's draw, and was the oldest male to reach the Round of 16 since 1972. That age began to show.</p>
        <p>After the second set, Bjorkman called for a trainer to work out a knot in his right shoulder. Then, he needed a painkiller. Bjorkman said that he expected his body to feel even worse later.</p>
        <p>''It could be tough sometimes to put the socks on,'' he said, referring to the morning after a match.</p>
        <p>While the old-timers Moyá and Bjorkman were playing, the youngest player left in the men's draw, the 20-year-old Novak Djokovic, was trying to make it to the quarterfinals for the second year in a row. Last year, he played Nadal in that round but retired with an injured lower back.</p>
        <p>Healthy now, the sixth-seeded Djokovic played his best match yet in Paris, defeating Fernando Verdasco, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (1). He is considered one of the few who could rival Nadal or No. 1 Roger Federer in the final.</p>
        <p>''I didn't come here with the goal to win the tournament, like that was my goal before I started to play,'' Djokovic said. ''Like I said before, I am trying to go step by step.''</p>
        <p>In the quarterfinals, Djokovic will play Igor Andreev, who is ranked 125th and who knocked No. 3 Andy Roddick out of the tournament in the first round. He beat Marcos Baghdatis, the 16th seed, 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
        <p>Djokovic's victory also means that three Serbs have made it to the quarterfinals. Compatriots Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic will play their quarterfinal matches Tuesday. Jankovic, the fourth seed, will take on No. 6 Nicole Vaidisova. Ivanovic, seeded seventh, will meet No. 3 Svetlana Kuznetsova. In another quarterfinal, No. 2 Maria Sharapova will play No. 9 Anna Chakvetadze.</p>
        <p>But the most anticipated women's match will pit Serena Williams, winner of eight Grand Slam singles titles, against No. 1 Justine Henin, the two-time defending French Open champion. It is a rematch of the 2003 semifinal, which was marked by an angry crowd, Henin's gamesmanship and Williams's tears as she was booed off the court after losing in three sets.</p>
        <p>The Moyá-Nadal quarterfinal will not end up that way. Each said he admired the other's game and friendship.</p>
        <p>Nadal said that having a player like Moyá to look up to in Majorca was ''very, very important'' to him. He often practiced with Moyá and received tips from him.</p>
        <p>Moyá said: ''I don't think he learned anything from me. And if he learned it, he did much better than me.''</p>
