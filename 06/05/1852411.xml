        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday appointed a former Nassau County official as the new president of the Long Island Rail Road. The appointee, Helena E. Williams, a lawyer, served as a deputy county executive in Nassau County from late 2002 until February. She had previously worked at the authority and had run its Long Island Bus division from 1993 to 1998. Ms. Williams, who is to begin work on June 18, will be the first woman to run the Long Island Rail Road, the country's busiest commuter railroad, with 82 million riders each year. The previous president, James J. Dermody, retired in September. Raymond P. Kenny has been serving as acting president. Ms. Williams, a resident of Nassau County since 1985, lives in Garden City. As head of the railroad, she will receive a yearly compensation package worth $272,000.</p>
