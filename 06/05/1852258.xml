        <p>Consuming high levels of vitamin D and calcium may offer some protection against the most aggressive kinds of breast cancer, a new study reports, but only in premenopausal women.</p>
        <p>Researchers studied 10,578 premenopausal and 20,909 postmenopausal women, using data gathered as part of a larger long-term study of women's health. All the participants had filled out extensive dietary questionnaires, and the researchers computed their intake of vitamin D and calcium. During an average 10 years of follow-up, 276 premenopausal and 743 postmenopausal women were found to have invasive breast cancer. The paper appeared May 28 in The Archives of Internal Medicine.</p>

        <p>Consuming high levels of vitamin D and calcium may offer some protection against the most aggressive kinds of breast cancer, a new study reports, but only in premenopausal women.</p>
        <p>Researchers studied 10,578 premenopausal and 20,909 postmenopausal women, using data gathered as part of a larger long-term study of women's health. All the participants had filled out extensive dietary questionnaires, and the researchers computed their intake of vitamin D and calcium. During an average 10 years of follow-up, 276 premenopausal and 743 postmenopausal women were found to have invasive breast cancer. The paper appeared May 28 in The Archives of Internal Medicine.</p>
        <p>The one-fifth of premenopausal women who consumed the highest levels of vitamin D and calcium -- more than 1,366 milligrams of calcium and 948 units of vitamin D daily -- had a one-third reduced risk of developing breast cancer compared with those who consumed the least, fewer than 617 grams of calcium and under 162 units of vitamin D. The association was particularly strong for the most malignant and aggressive kinds of tumors.</p>
        <p>''This was only an observational study,'' said Jennifer Lin, the lead author and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard, ''so I would not recommend that women take more than the recommended amounts of calcium or vitamin D. I would suggest instead that women take at least the suggested values to keep up their overall health, and possibly to prevent breast cancer.''</p>
        <p>One thousand milligrams of calcium and 200 to 600 units of vitamin D a day are considered adequate.</p>
