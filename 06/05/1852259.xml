        <p>Some recent studies have suggested that lycopene, a chemical in tomatoes and other red fruits, is protective against prostate cancer, but a large prospective study has found that it has no effect.</p>

        <p>Some recent studies have suggested that lycopene, a chemical in tomatoes and other red fruits, is protective against prostate cancer, but a large prospective study has found that it has no effect.</p>
        <p>The study  included 28,243 men, 55 to 74 years old, who were recruited as part of a larger cancer screening. The researchers measured blood concentrations of lycopene, beta carotene, lutein and other carotenoids in 692 randomly selected men in the sample who later developed prostate cancer, and 844 men who did not.</p>
        <p>After controlling for other variables, the scientists found no link between prostate cancer and blood concentrations of lycopene or other carotenoids, except that men with the highest blood levels of beta carotene were somewhat more likely to suffer from aggressive disease than those with the lowest concentrations.</p>
        <p>Richard B. Hayes, a co-author of the paper and a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, said the study ''provides an important contribution to the debate about the preventive potential of lycopene.''</p>
        <p>The study is based on blood samples collected before any diagnosis was made, it has a large number of participants, and it includes details about the severity of the disease. But it used a single blood sample, so it could not examine long-term exposure to carotenoids.</p>
        <p>Writing in the May issue of Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, the authors said, ''Simple and inexpensive approaches to prostate cancer prevention would be of great public health significance, and it is unfortunate that the initial results on lycopene and tomato products from well-conducted studies could not be consistently replicated.''</p>
