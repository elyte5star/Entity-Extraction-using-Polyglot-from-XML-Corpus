        <p>As part of his series of farewells, Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed a government-organized conference on Islam on Monday, and declared that the religion's ''authentic voices'' should be given a stage over the voices of extremism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair, who has said he will take a special interest in interfaith affairs when he leaves office at the end of the month, said the true meaning of Islam had been hijacked by extremists.</p>
        <p>''The voices of extremism are no more representative of Islam than the use, in times gone by, of torture to force conversion to Christianity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Muslim leaders from Egypt, Indonesia, Bosnia, Western Europe and the United States joined a carefully selected group of British Muslims at Lancaster House in London for a two-day program that was organized by the government in conjunction with Cambridge University.</p>
        <p>The guest list, a subject of negotiations for the past several weeks, caused some British Muslims to complain that the conference was shaped to lend support for Mr. Blair's policies on Iraq and Afghanistan and to affirm government support for some British Muslim groups over others.</p>
        <p>The participants appeared to have been chosen on the grounds that they provided a bulwark against what the government considers extremist views. British officials have often spoken of ''inoculating'' mainstream British Muslims from the dangers of extremist thought.</p>
        <p>''It's a colonial style of conference, where the government has tried to divide the Muslim leadership and create a new one,'' said Lord Ahmed, who was appointed to the House of Lords by the Labor Party in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>Lord Ahmed, who was not invited to attend, said the government had excluded those who disagreed with Mr. Blair's policies on the effort to curb terrorism, as well as Afghanistan and Iraq. ''They've included people who don't have an opinion or who have remained silent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lord Ahmed said he was particularly annoyed that the prime minister of Pakistan, Shaukat Aziz, had been invited to present a video address. ''What can the Pakistani prime minister offer Britain about justice and the rule of law?'' Lord Ahmed said.</p>
        <p>One of the most popular speakers on Islam among mainstream British Muslims, the writer Tariq Ramadan, said several weeks ago that he had been invited to attend the conference but was concerned about being ''used'' by the Blair government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramadan, who has spoken at other British government events but has been barred by the Bush administration from entering the United States, was not present on Monday.</p>
        <p>Among those who were invited were Muslim academics from British universities, two Labor members of Parliament, and representatives of the British Muslim Forum and the Sufi Muslim Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair went out of his way to praise ''the overwhelming majority'' of Muslims who ''seek to play a part as loyal citizens of their countries and as loyal Muslims,'' He added, ''This is, of course, contrary to the often crude portrayals in the media or by those who deal only in stereotypes and seek to whip up Islamophobic sentiment.'' He acknowledged that he had learned that tough security measures were not the only way to tackle the problem of Islamic extremism.</p>
        <p>''I've become acutely aware we will not defeat this by security,'' he said in answer to a question from the audience. ''We will only defeat it if we have a motivating idea that is better than their ideas.''</p>
