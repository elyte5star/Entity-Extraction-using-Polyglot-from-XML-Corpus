      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says sexually exploited children are too often charged with prostitution instead of being treated as victims; calls for New York State Senate to pass Safe Harbor Act, under which sexually exploited children would be placed under state supervision and lodged in safe houses where they would get counseling and medical care they need</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The New York State Legislature is rightly pleased with itself for passing a new law that offers tougher penalties for sex traffickers, as well as help for their victims who are often smuggled in from abroad and forced to work as sex slaves. As important as it is, the trafficking law fails to deal with the serious and growing problem of American children, some as young as 13 years old, who are dragooned into prostitution by brutal pimps.</p>
        <p>The best way to care for these children would be for the State Senate to pass the Safe Harbor Act, a groundbreaking law that was passed by the House.</p>

        <p>The New York State Legislature is rightly pleased with itself for passing a new law that offers tougher penalties for sex traffickers, as well as help for their victims who are often smuggled in from abroad and forced to work as sex slaves. As important as it is, the trafficking law fails to deal with the serious and growing problem of American children, some as young as 13 years old, who are dragooned into prostitution by brutal pimps.</p>
        <p>The best way to care for these children would be for the State Senate to pass the Safe Harbor Act, a groundbreaking law that was passed by the House.</p>
        <p>By law, sexually exploited children are too young to even consent to sex. But instead of treating them as victims, prosecutors too often charge them with prostitution and send them off to the juvenile equivalent of jail. Under the Safe Harbor law, sexually exploited children would no longer be charged with prostitution. They would be placed under state supervision and lodged in safe houses where they would get the counseling and medical care they need and are unlikely to receive in detention.</p>
        <p>The law also provides for long-term housing, which is a central issue, given that many of these children have been driven into the streets by abusive parents and have no homes to return to.</p>
        <p>Some prosecutors who oppose the bill say that the charge of prostitution is crucial to getting these children to testify against the pimps. But children who have been brainwashed, beaten and forced to sell themselves on the street are often in no condition to face their abusers in court. Beyond that, the law needs to foster and protect these children, instead of victimizing them yet again.</p>
