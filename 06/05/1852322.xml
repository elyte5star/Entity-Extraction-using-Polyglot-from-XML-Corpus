        <p>A few months ago, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would ''deck'' anyone who attacked her during the presidential campaign. The idea was that she would fight back rather than allow herself to be ''Swift boated'' the way Senator John Kerry was in 2004, when he found his Vietnam War record assailed.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have been stepping up their verbal attacks on Mrs. Clinton. So far she has stayed above the fray.

        <p>A few months ago, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would ''deck'' anyone who attacked her during the presidential campaign. The idea was that she would fight back rather than allow herself to be ''Swift boated'' the way Senator John Kerry was in 2004, when he found his Vietnam War record assailed.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have been stepping up their verbal attacks on Mrs. Clinton. So far she has stayed above the fray. It is a classic front-runner strategy. But she is also trying not to fuel critics who say she is a polarizing figure.</p>
        <p>Rudolph W. Giuliani criticized her during a Republican debate in mid-May, portraying her as opposing the free-market system and favoring high taxes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's response? ''I didn't see the debate.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Mitt Romney said that as president, Mrs. Clinton would create a socialist-style welfare state. Her platform, he told voters in Iowa, ''wouldn't even get her elected in France.''</p>
        <p>The Associated Press reported that the Clinton campaign declined to respond to Mr. Romney.</p>
        <p>In Sunday night's Democratic debate, former Senator John Edwards accused Mrs. Clinton of being a follower, not a leader, for not speaking out on the Iraq war financing bill. Mrs. Clinton's response: ''The differences among us are minor,'' she said. ''The differences between us and the Republicans are major.''</p>
