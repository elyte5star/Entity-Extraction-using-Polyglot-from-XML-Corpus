        <p>In their first face-to-face meeting, the family that controls Dow Jones &amp; Company yesterday told Rupert Murdoch, a suitor some family members mistrust deeply, that it would sell him the company only if its jewel, The Wall Street Journal, could be shielded from editorial interference from him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch made clear that he would not accept the terms of the Bancroft family's proposal, which would give a board of independent overseers the power to hire and fire top editors, according to people who were present or were briefed by participants, but, they said, Mr. Murdoch floated an alternate arrangement in the meeting, which lasted almost five hours.</p>
        <p>''Both sides laid out the way they thought it should work, and neither side agreed with the other, but they're eager to keep talking,'' said someone who was briefed on the meeting but who was unauthorized to speak on behalf of the participants. ''It was all very pleasant on both sides, but there's still plenty of distance between the two.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation made an offer in April but the family initially rejected his bid.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, the Bancrofts reconsidered, arguing that Dow Jones could not continue operating as it was and agreeing to meet Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's discussions did not include a price, although it is widely believed that the Bancrofts will be looking for Mr. Murdoch to raise his offer of $60 a share. Mr. Murdoch has said he does not intend to increase his bid. He and his representatives asked to meet again today, but the family demurred, suggesting that some directors will discuss the negotiations by phone before the two sides get together again, as soon as Wednesday but more likely in a few days.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Murdoch's son James, 34, followed a speech by his father and spoke at length about News Corporation's dealings with China, saying the company had not allowed its business considerations to influence its journalism.</p>
        <p>News Corporation has been accused of censoring coverage that was critical of the Chinese government to stay in its good graces, and several years ago, the younger Mr. Murdoch, who led the company's China operations, publicly disparaged two of the government's most potent critics: the Falun Gong movement and the Dalai Lama.</p>
        <p>Critics of the elder Mr. Murdoch, 76, say that from British tabloids to The New York Post to Fox News, he has a long pattern of bending journalism to serve his business and political ends. Members of the Bancroft family and many Journal newsroom employees have expressed their fear of editorial interference.</p>
        <p>The Bancrofts pitched their idea for a board of overseers for The Journal in a written proposal presented at the meeting. The board's initial members would be chosen by the family and, just as important, would choose their successors in perpetuity, according to people close to the family.</p>
        <p>Similar arrangements govern many of the nation's biggest philanthropic foundations, often with the result that the charities are free to pursue aims that would not please their wealthy founders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch studied the Bancroft's document but, after some discussion, said it was not workable for him, according to people briefed on the meeting.</p>
        <p>Bringing out his own written proposal, he offered a less independent sort of governing board like the one at The Times of London when he acquired it, with some members appointed by him, a structure that did not prevent him from forcing out the editor, Harry Evans, in short order.</p>
        <p>Under the current configuration of the Times's board, he explained, he could appoint the paper's editor but the editor would need to be approved by the independent board. Similarly, he could not remove the editor without the concurrence of the board.</p>
        <p>According to two people briefed on the meeting, Mr. Murdoch's proposal was well received by the Bancroft family representatives and Martin Lipton, a lawyer representing them.</p>
        <p>But Dow Jones's chairman, M. Peter McPherson, was cool to the proposal even as it seemed to other attendees that a deal might be near, these people said. Mr. McPherson called for a break so that the Bancrofts could study the News Corporation proposal more closely.</p>
        <p>Both sides caucused for more than an hour, and when they resumed in the late afternoon, Mr. McPherson was more amenable, these people said.</p>
        <p>The Bancrofts have viewed their own lack of involvement in Dow Jones, the antithesis of Mr. Murdoch's hands-on management, as crucial to maintaining The Journal's integrity and independence. They take pride in the paper, and disdain many of Mr. Murdoch's properties.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Murdoch, emerging from the meeting, and an anodyne statement from the family, described the session as ''constructive,'' but gave no details. Both sides expect to meet again in the next few days, but no gathering has been scheduled yet.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's meeting, at the Midtown Manhattan offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, lawyers for the family, drew widely scattered participants, including the three members of the Bancroft family who sit on the Dow Jones board: Christopher Bancroft, who lives in Texas; Leslie Hill, from Maryland; and Elizabeth Steele, from Vermont.</p>
        <p>Alongside them were Michael Elefante, a Dow Jones board member and the Boston-based lawyer who is the chief trustee for the family trusts that control most of the Bancrofts' stock, and Mr. McPherson.</p>
        <p>James Murdoch, the only one of Rupert Murdoch's four adult children who is currently involved in the business, came from London. He is chief executive of BSkyB, the British satellite television company in which News Corporation is the major shareholder. Accompanying him and his father at the meeting were Lawrence A. Jacobs, the group general counsel of the News Corporation, and David F. DeVoe, its longtime chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch has long coveted Dow Jones and The Journal -- leaders in business journalism for more than a century -- and all the more so now because he intends to begin a cable business news channel this year to compete with CNBC. The trust readers put in The Journal, and the information produced by the newspaper and other Dow Jones properties like Dow Jones Newswires and Marketwatch.com, could give such a channel credibility that would otherwise take years to build.</p>
        <p>News Corporation offered $60 a share for Dow Jones, which was trading around $36 in late April, before news of the bid became public. Since Friday, the stock has traded above the offer price -- closing yesterday at $60.16 -- indicating that investors expect the sale to go through, possibly at a higher price. The elder Bancrofts, whose family has owned a controlling interest in the company since 1902, initially rejected the overture. But their advisers, including some Dow Jones officials, and their children's generation persuaded them that the company's prospects in a field of much larger competitors were not strong.</p>
