        <p>From a distance, Animal Collective always looks like a band that's going to make a lot of noise. The jungle-y name, with its co-operative implications; the group's love of echo and yelping, unusual percussion and guitar strumming; the fact that any of its four members might or might not be playing on their albums or tours: you could add this up and reasonably assume that Animal Collective is one of those bands that it's more fun to be in than to see.</p>
        <p>But melody and rhythm, much more than dissonance, sets them free. Animal Collective played as a three-piece band on Friday night outside at South Street Seaport, opening this year's River to River Festival, and in the absence of its guitarist, Deakin (known to his parents as Josh Dibb), its music grew even sweeter.</p>

        <p>From a distance, Animal Collective always looks like a band that's going to make a lot of noise. The jungle-y name, with its co-operative implications; the group's love of echo and yelping, unusual percussion and guitar strumming; the fact that any of its four members might or might not be playing on their albums or tours: you could add this up and reasonably assume that Animal Collective is one of those bands that it's more fun to be in than to see.</p>
        <p>But melody and rhythm, much more than dissonance, sets them free. Animal Collective played as a three-piece band on Friday night outside at South Street Seaport, opening this year's River to River Festival, and in the absence of its guitarist, Deakin (known to his parents as Josh Dibb), its music grew even sweeter.</p>
        <p>This was a band with traditional jobs mutated and ranks tightened; the axis now tilted more toward Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), one of the band's two lead singers, whose songs are harmony-rich and choirboy-innocent.</p>
        <p>Where Avey Tare (Dave Portner) used to play guitar and sing, now the guitar was gone: he sang and fiddled with a mixer. Where Panda Bear used to be its singer and drummer, here he spent more time on keyboards and electronics, turning only occasionally to a shrunken idea of a drum kit: one high-hat, one small cymbal, one floor tom. Only Geologist (Brian Weitz) was as he has usually seen, hovering over a table of digital equipment and driving the backing tracks and samples.</p>
        <p>Singing has become an ever-more serious proposition in this band, and Panda Bear has led that charge. His own record, ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), all repetition, stacked harmonies and summery euphony, came out in April and has become as admired an Animal Collective record as any made with the rest of the group. But if Panda Bear is the guileless one, singing in careful long-tones and jumping registers in and out of his falsetto, Avey Tare is the trickster. When he wasn't singing spooky provocations (''Are you also frightened?'' went one new song's refrain), he whooped and hissed in counterpoint to Panda Bear, playing a role analogous to a hip-hop hype-man.</p>
        <p>Animal Collective tends to play new music in performance: this means music that hasn't been recorded yet, not the music that will appear on its next album, ''Strawberry Jam'' (Domino), in September. (Bits of that, from earlier concerts, has already gone up on YouTube.) With hardly any drums and only fleeting bits of guitar tone, Friday night's unrecognizable parts were more synthetic and less earthbound than ever; some stretches also drew closer to various kinds of dance music, from early disco to reggae.</p>
        <p>The band is 7 years old now, and with age comes responsibilities. It has proven itself as a reliably cathartic live band and has come into a loving audience. Naturally, some of its older songs now pass for greatest hits. Animal Collective obliged the fans with encores, including ''Leaf House,'' a song with a lot of quick, compulsive, jumping notes. The big, free-concert crowd jabbered along in rhythm.</p>
