        <p>The gifted composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg (1919-1996) said he considered himself Shostakovich's ''pupil, his flesh and blood.'' Given how frequently those two friends met to compare notes and the difficult circumstances in which they composed, it's not surprising that Mr. Weinberg's musical language sounds like a dialect of Shostakovich's.</p>
        <p>It's also possible that Mr. Weinberg might have inspired some of the Jewish themes and styles in Shostakovich's music. Mr. Weinberg was as prolific as his mentor (who facilitated his 1943 move to Moscow), with a catalog that includes 26 symphonies, 17 string quartets, 7 operas and numerous concertos, sonatas, songs and film scores.</p>
        <p>On Sunday at Avery Fisher Hall, Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra were persuasive advocates for Mr. Weinberg's Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra (Op. 94) (1967) and in the United States premiere of his Symphony No. 6 for Children's Choir and Orchestra (Op. 79) (1963).</p>
        <p>The irony and despair in Mr. Weinberg's music tends to simmer under the surface instead of exploding in tormented outbursts like Shostakovich's. Certainly Mr. Weinberg did not have much to be cheery about. Born in Warsaw to a musical Jewish family, he endured the murders of his parents and sister by the Nazis in Poland after he fled east to Minsk and later Tashkent, in what was then Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinberg was then arrested in 1953 on charges of ''Jewish bourgeois nationalism'' before Shostakovich courageously intervened on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Carl Albach was the excellent soloist in Mr. Weinberg's virtuosic trumpet concerto, which opened the program. Fragmented thematic ideas and Shostakovian burlesque in ''Études,'' the first movement, lead to the darker ''Episodes.'' In the concluding ''Fanfares'' Mr. Weinberg quotes from Mendelssohn, Mahler and Bizet, among others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinberg's Symphony No. 6, written a year after Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13, ''Babi Yar'' (1962), is a five-movement tribute to murdered children, with a Shostakovich-inspired scherzo and Jewish dance music.</p>
        <p>The second movement uses a lighthearted poem by the Yiddish poet Lev Kvitko; the fourth is set to a text by Samuil Galkinreferring to the Holocaust; and the fifth to an evocative text by the Soviet author Mikhail Lukonin.</p>
        <p>The clear young voices of the Brooklyn Youth Chorus in Mr. Weinberg's work were in striking contrast to the thundering basses of the Concert Chorale of New York in Shostakovich's ''Babi Yar,'' which concluded the program. The soloist in the latter was the bass-baritone Sergei Leiferkus, who delivered a powerful performance in this stirringly poignant work, which takes its title from a poem by Yevgeny Yevtushenko commemorating the 1941 massacre of nearly 34,000 Jews at a ravine in Kiev.</p>
