        <p>Re: ''For the Tiniest Babies, the Closest Thing to a Cocoon'' (May 29): Christine Hauser notes that the obvious best place for a premature baby would be the ''exquisitely complex environment'' of amniotic fluid and that the womb room is the second best place. That is surely true for preemies born just a few weeks early. But technology, no matter how high, cannot offer extremely premature newborns everything they need for full, healthy development.</p>

        <p>Researchers have not characterized all biochemicals in pregnant women and all genes of the fetus that induce maturation; thus the complex uterine environment cannot be replicated in an intensive care unit. To focus on survivability rates while ignoring the pain-filled, isolated and dependent lives typical for most micro-preemies misleads future parents into believing there's a technological solution for every insufficiency of physiology.</p>
