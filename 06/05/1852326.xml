        <p>Rudolph W. Giuliani has come under fire from the Roman Catholic bishop of Providence, R.I., who has criticized Mr. Giuliani's support of abortion rights, calling the position pathetic, confusing and hypocritical.</p>
        <p>In a column in The Rhode Island Catholic, the diocesan newspaper, Bishop Thomas J. Tobin compared Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, to Pontius Pilate, who, Bishop Tobin said, allowed Jesus to be executed though he personally did not believe him guilty of anything.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, whose campaign refused to comment, has tried to move past the abortion debate by suggesting that voters judge him more broadly than on just one issue. In a speech last month in Houston, he said although he personally believed that abortion was wrong and that he would counsel a woman not to have one, he ultimately believed that it was a choice for the woman to make.</p>
        <p>Bishop Tobin suggested that position raised serious questions about Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''Rudy's preposterous position is compounded by the fact that he professes to be a Catholic'' Bishop Tobin wrote. ''As Catholics, we are called, indeed required to be pro-life, to cherish and protect human life as a precious gift of God from the moment of conception until the time of natural death. As a leader, as a public official, Rudy Giuliani has a special obligation in that regard.''</p>
        <p>''I can just hear Pilate saying, 'You know, I'm personally opposed to crucifixion but I don't want to impose my belief on others,' '' he wrote.</p>
        <p>In the 2004 presidential election, 12 bishops joined to urge that Senator John Kerry, a Democrat who backs abortion rights, not be allowed to receive communion because of his stance. Bishop Tobin is the first top Catholic official to condemn Mr. Giuliani publicly.</p>
