        <p>Editorial supports plan by Connecticut Department of Transportation to extend regional train service to Jets and Giants home games at Meadowlands</p>

        <p>The announcement that the state Department of Transportation plans to extend regional train service to sporting events is a good sign that the department is no longer trying to pave over the entire state but is shifting its focus to mass transit. This is welcome news in a state whose neglect of mass transit has led to more air pollution and congested highways.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, several trains would take football fans to Secaucus, N.J., to attend Giants or Jets games at the nearby Meadowlands, beginning during the 2009 season. The department previously announced a joint effort with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to set up train service to Yankees games at the team's new ballpark starting the same year.</p>

        <p>The football service would not be a direct shot. Riders would travel from Connecticut to New Rochelle, N.Y., then board a train following an Amtrak route into Penn Station, from which they would be transported to Secaucus, where they could pick up a shuttle train to the stadium. But because of construction at the stadium in 2009, only season ticket holders will be able to park there anyway, which means that Connecticut riders will not be the only fans asked to negotiate a more complicated route.</p>
        <p>The pilot program is worth a try, and the significance of these proposals goes beyond sports. It shows a change in mentality. Expanding train service is a lot easier than expanding highways, after all.</p>
