        <p>HBO does not want you to stop believing in HBO just because ''The Sopranos'' is no longer with us. The network is ensuring that we remain fed. Among its new series is a comedy called ''FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS,'' making its debut on Sunday at 10:30 p.m. It delivers the exploits of a two-man band from New Zealand that seeks its fortune in New York under the guidance of a manager who moonlights -- or, rather, daylights -- at the country's consulate in Manhattan. Approach with caution if sideburns constitute a look you cannot abide.</p>
        <p>''MEADOWLANDS,'' a new series on Showtime also beginning on Sunday (at 10 p.m.) is not actually about the Meadowlands, which is to say it is not here to satisfy our New Jersey fetish. Like ''The Riches'' on FX, this show is about obscured identities, a family in hiding, criminal pasts, the secrets suburban developments harbor. If Jimmy Hoffa's body turns up by the final episode, disregard all of what's been said. The show will have been about the New Jersey Meadowlands after all.</p>
        <p>New seasons of ''THE 4400'' and ''THE DEAD ZONE,'' both on the USA network, also begin on Sunday, and Monday brings the debut of ''HEARTLAND'' (TNT, 10 p.m.), a new medical drama starring Treat Williams in which nothing as mundane as a knee replacement bogs the doctors down. Here, Mr. Williams plays an organ-transplant surgeon who must deal with the miseries of replacing failing kidneys -- and with a co-worker who happens to be his ex-wife.</p>
