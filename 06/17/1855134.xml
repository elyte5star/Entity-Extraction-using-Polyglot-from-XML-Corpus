        <p>Lisa Curran's figure-flattering classic tank bathing suit has earned a following among women who dread shopping for a swimsuit. This year, Ms. Curran is endearing herself to this set with three new variations on the theme. Her shirred one-piece, which has a deep V-neck and exaggerated shirring down the front to hide imperfections ($150), hit stores this season and 5,000 suits quickly flew out the doors; the company re-cut the suit in new colors to meet demand. Her Retro one-piece (far right, $150) and Twisted Two-Tone (right, a 70s-inspired take on the classic tank, $148, all at Lisacurran.com) also sold out in a week and are being reshipped to stores. To be sure, these aren't the most daring get-ups around; Brazilian beach material they are not. Then again, neither are most bodies.</p>
