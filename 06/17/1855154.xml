        <p>EVERY Friday outside the red brick facade of Queens Borough Hall in Kew Gardens, couples in various modes of dress -- including the occasional long white gown -- can be seen filing past a stained sign written in faded black marker. An arrow labeled ''Summons Line'' points to the left; another, labeled ''Marriage,'' points right.</p>
        <p>For Queens couples equipped with a witness, a marriage license and $25 for the ceremony fee, this is where weddings begin. Nine miles from the far more celebrated city clerk's office in the Manhattan Municipal Building, some 9,000 couples tied the knot here last year. About 60 couples show up on an average Friday, the most popular day, and slightly more on Fridays in June, a traditional month for weddings.</p>

        <p>EVERY Friday outside the red brick facade of Queens Borough Hall in Kew Gardens, couples in various modes of dress -- including the occasional long white gown -- can be seen filing past a stained sign written in faded black marker. An arrow labeled ''Summons Line'' points to the left; another, labeled ''Marriage,'' points right.</p>
        <p>For Queens couples equipped with a witness, a marriage license and $25 for the ceremony fee, this is where weddings begin. Nine miles from the far more celebrated city clerk's office in the Manhattan Municipal Building, some 9,000 couples tied the knot here last year. About 60 couples show up on an average Friday, the most popular day, and slightly more on Fridays in June, a traditional month for weddings.</p>
        <p>A line forms at 8:30 in the morning. Couples enter a tiny, rarely visited chapel where the deputy city clerk for Queens presides over a brief exchange of vows. The couples emerge into a courtyard, where a ponytailed man named David is waiting with a Polaroid camera and an arbor of flowers; photos are $10. Occasionally a couple will pose in front of a Redbird subway car, retired from the No. 7 line, that is parked nearby.</p>
        <p>Afterward, some couples head to parties or nearby restaurants. Others simply linger on the grass, blissful because life has started anew in Queens.</p>
