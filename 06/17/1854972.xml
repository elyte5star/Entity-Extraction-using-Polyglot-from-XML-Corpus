        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) MEADOWLANDS -- This dark new series follows the Brogans, who aren't exactly what they seem, as they move to this spooky English suburban paradise, where none of their neighbors are what they seem either. David Morrissey plays Danny Brogan, the patriarch of a family trying to make a fresh start in a witness protection program. Lucy Cohu plays his wife and the mother of their teenage twins, Zoe (Felicity Jones) and Mark (Harry Treadaway), above.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (WE) BRIDEZILLAS -- ''They're madder. They're badder. They're back.'' Say no more.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) FOYLE'S WAR, SERIES IV: INVASION -- When a young British barmaid is found murdered on an American Army base after a clandestine affair with a soldier, Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) breaks with government orders and tries to figure out whether the American killed his unfaithful lover -- or was framed.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BBCA) CHARLES &amp; WILLIAM: ROYAL RIVALS? -- What happens when the son becomes more popular than the father? This documentary speculates about a royal relationship as public opinion grows in favor of Prince William ascending to the throne ahead of his father, Prince Charles.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (HBO) ENTOURAGE -- The boys, right, are back and in fine form as they venture into the Colombian jungle in this Season 4 premiere, which goes behind the scenes on the set of ''Medellin.'' Eric (Kevin Connolly) and Billy (Rhys Coiro) clash over keeping the schedule, Billy develops an infatuation with the beautiful co-star of Vince (Adrian Grenier) and Drama (Kevin Dillon) angles for his own piece of the action, at least in the film.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (History Channel) ICE ROAD TRUCKERS -- For two months each year a group of truckers take equipment and supplies to miners in the Canadian tundra. That means driving 18-wheelers over frozen lakes. This new series follows the drivers as they race to reach the miners and get back before frozen roads return to water.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (HBO) FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS -- They're birds of a rather peculiar feather. This new comedy series follows Jemaine Clement, center, and Bret McKenzie, near left, New Zealanders living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, as they seek out sites where they can perform, court women and generally try to express themselves with music.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (USA) THE DEAD ZONE -- The sixth season's first episode begins with Johnny Smith (Anthony Michael Hall) having visions of a friend's death and ends with major changes for the series. Preceded at 9 by the fourth-season opener of ''The 4400.''</p>
