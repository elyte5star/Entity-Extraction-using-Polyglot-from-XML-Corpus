        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Knocked Up'' is a comedy about a young woman who gets pregnant with a man she doesn't know. If she decides to have an abortion eight minutes into the movie, there isn't much of a comedy left. It is true that American movies seldom depict abortions -- but there are a lot of things American movies seldom depict. Like sex between unattractive people. Or life as we know it.</p>

        <p>I don't think Hollywood shuns the topic of abortion in fear of anything but boredom. Abortion is not -- as a plot point -- interesting or dramatic enough, and certainly not funny.</p>
