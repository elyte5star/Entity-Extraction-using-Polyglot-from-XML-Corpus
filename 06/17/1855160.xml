        <p>Marine Park, a leafy neighborhood of detached houses in southern Brooklyn, is a quiet place where neighbors are proud to say they know one another. The kind of place, as the president of the Marine Park Civic Association, Greg Borruso, says, where if you don't water your lawn on Tuesday, a neighbor will water it for you on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Local news, then, tends to travel fast, and the flip side, as local Verizon representatives found out in recent weeks, is that people do not like being taken by surprise. The company, which is installing fiber-optic cables nationwide to support its high-speed Internet and television service, has started work in Brooklyn, where it has already put up about 100 new utility poles. In Marine Park, the poles have touched off a furor.</p>
        <p>The issue, residents say, is that many houses in the neighborhood have never had poles in front of them: they have either buried utility cables or poles in the back. Rather than burying the new fiber-optic lines, though, or using the back poles, the company has been erecting new ones in front of houses, often to the surprise of unsuspecting homeowners.</p>
        <p>The local objections, which began to surface late last month and were reported in The Kings Courier, a neighborhood weekly, has not been kind. ''If you lived in a house without a telephone pole in front of your house, and then one day you came home and there was this 45-foot pole, you'd be pretty upset, too,'' Mr. Borruso said. ''What they don't understand is, people feel like they've been violated.''</p>
        <p>Residents' protests, which on at least one block have led to a petition against the new poles, have drawn the support of the local community board. ''If I was to come home from work and find a pole in front of my house, I would literally smash it and pull it down,'' said Dorothy Turano, the board district manager. ''I would go out of my mind.''</p>
        <p>In response, John Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman, explained that potential problems could be associated with burying the cables or stringing them behind houses, and said that tearing up the street or waiting to gain access to backyards would hamper workers' ability to move quickly.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, company representatives plan to speak with area residents about their grievances, although it was unclear whether the company would alter its plans. ''I really can't say yes or no,'' Mr. Bonomo said. ''The first thing we want to do is engage the community.''</p>
        <p>Time, he added, is of the essence.</p>
        <p>''It's really quite an advance in technology, and our intention is really getting out there as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Bonomo said. ''There's really a cry for it.''</p>
