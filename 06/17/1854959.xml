        <p>One of the reasons we need THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, the traveling series of mostly documentary films that arrives in New York City on Friday, is the chance to see a film like ''Hot House,'' Shimon Dotan's study of Palestinan prisoners in Israel's highest-security jails. A detailed examination of prison life, ''Hot House,'' which has its New York premiere on June 25, includes interviews with many prisoners involved in suicide bombings. Most express no remorse for their deadly actions and reject the term ''terrorists'' in favor of ''freedom fighters.''</p>
        <p>This politically even-handed film, which won a special jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, suggests that the system which houses some 10,000 ''security prisoners,'' some of them for life, only fortifies the zeal of the terrorists who regard prison as an educational institution for the sharing of ideas and the development of strategy. It concludes that prison is an efficient incubator for future radical Palestinian leaders.</p>
        <p>The festival, at the Walter Reade Theater, opens with ''Mon Colonel,'' a film directed by Costa-Gravas and Jean-Claude Grumberg that offers another look back at the French-Algerian war. It closes next week with ''The Devil Came on Horseback,'' the portrait by Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern of Brian Steidle, a former Marine Corps captain whose photographs of the Darfur killing fields awakened the world to mass slaughter that continues.</p>
        <p>Another outstanding selection is Alejandro Landes's ''Cocalero,'' which follows the rise of President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a grass-roots politician backed by impoverished coca farmers threatened by the American war on drugs. ''The Unforeseen,'' by Laura Dunn, investigates the battle between real-estate developers in Austin, Tex., and environmental activists.</p>
        <p>The uncomfortable truth revealed by these films is that there are no easy solutions to the world's ills; that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction that may be delayed but is eventually felt. Friday through June 28, Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809, filmlinc.com; $11, $7 for members.</p>
