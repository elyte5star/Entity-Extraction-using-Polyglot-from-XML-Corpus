        <p>JOHN IRVING LEVENBERG, who was hired in 2005 to set the style for the winemaking team at Bedell Cellars in Cutchogue, has begun to leave his imprint. A new white, a rosé and three reds all reflect the pleasure principle.</p>
        <p>The lovely 2006 Domaines CC rosé ($16) from Corey Creek Vineyards in Southold, Bedell's sister property, captures the whiff and flavors of the garrigue, the scrubland of Provence. This salmon-pink, bone-dry wine, most expressive when moderately chilled, is a zingy aperitif.</p>

        <p>JOHN IRVING LEVENBERG, who was hired in 2005 to set the style for the winemaking team at Bedell Cellars in Cutchogue, has begun to leave his imprint. A new white, a rosé and three reds all reflect the pleasure principle.</p>
        <p>The lovely 2006 Domaines CC rosé ($16) from Corey Creek Vineyards in Southold, Bedell's sister property, captures the whiff and flavors of the garrigue, the scrubland of Provence. This salmon-pink, bone-dry wine, most expressive when moderately chilled, is a zingy aperitif.</p>
        <p>Big, assertive, creamy yet fairly simple, Corey Creek's 2006 gewürztraminer ($30) echoes its model, from Alsace. A perfumed blockbuster, it has a dense aroma and flavor of litchis and a long aftertaste. Bedell's juicy 2005 cabernet franc ($30), containing 75 percent of that grape, 15 percent merlot and 10 percent cabernet franc, reflects the singularly hot and dry growing season. Plush and smooth, it is redolent of dark licorice, unsweetened raspberry sauce and cherries.</p>
        <p>As custodians of 27-year-old Bedell Cellars' enviable reputation for merlot -- the region's signature red grape and wine -- Mr. Levenberg, Kip Bedell (the former owner, who is under contract to the winery) and Kelly Urbanik, assistant winemaker, have elevated it with the 2005 regular merlot ($25) and 2005 merlot reserve ($40).</p>
        <p>Lushly aromatic, the regular version offers a bouquet of dark fruits and inviting woodiness. It tastes like a mélange of black currant and tobacco, with a background of wood; it is gutsy, meaty, grapey, yet supple.</p>
        <p>I can't dispute the winery's assertion that the 2005 reserve merlot, redolent of blackberries, is ''drinkable now'' and will be rewarding after five to 10 years' cellaring. It is more refined and complex than the basic merlot. Its lovely smokiness comes from French white-oak barrels made by several boutique cooperages.</p>
        <p>The 2005 Taste Red ($30) introduces syrah into a Bedell red blend for the first time. Mr. Levenberg and Mr. Bedell were joined in its production by their Chilean consultant, Pascal Marty. This voluptuous, raspberrylike blend is a confection that rewards contemplation.</p>
