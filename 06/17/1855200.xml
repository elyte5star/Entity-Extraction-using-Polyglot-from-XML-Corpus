        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed ''The Art of Buying Art, With the Help of an Adviser'' (May 27). Although it was correct in stating that there are no formal certifications for the profession, it should be noted that the International Association of Professional Art Advisors does have standards that members adhere to. Members cannot have gallery affiliations, represent artists or own any inventory. These parameters avoid conflict of interest and the consultant/adviser represents the client's best interests in transactions.</p>
