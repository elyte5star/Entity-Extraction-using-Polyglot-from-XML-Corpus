        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am writing with considerable concern and disappointment with regard to your June 10 article ''The Hallelujah People.'' When your reporter interviewed me over the phone, I discussed Latino religion and the circumstances of new immigrants generally. With regard to the group Growing in Grace, about which I clearly admitted very little familiarity, I concluded that its significance within the larger picture of Latino religiosity was minimal, at best.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am writing with considerable concern and disappointment with regard to your June 10 article ''The Hallelujah People.'' When your reporter interviewed me over the phone, I discussed Latino religion and the circumstances of new immigrants generally. With regard to the group Growing in Grace, about which I clearly admitted very little familiarity, I concluded that its significance within the larger picture of Latino religiosity was minimal, at best.</p>
        <p>Had you reported this -- and put my quotes on recent immigrants and their needs and contributions in context -- there would have been much less substance to the story. As is, it appeared that this group represented some kind of an emerging mainstream religious trend among Latinos.</p>
        <p>It seems to me essential that such an examination at least acknowledge the very strong ongoing Latino support for Catholicism -- with all of its shortcomings -- as well as the tremendous impact of countless well-established Protestant denominations.</p>
