        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Pervasive graffiti was the scourge that defaced the city when times were bad. Now, just as the city has reached a peak of prosperity and pizzazz, it is those monstrous sidewalk sheds that are defacing streets everywhere, not just in Manhattan (''The Great Midtown Cover-Up,'' June 10).</p>
        <p>Walking, once the greatest of urban pleasures, has become thoroughly unpleasant, and the effect on merchants shrouded under those eyesores can be devastating. It is time for the City Council and the Buildings Department to revisit Local Law 11 and its unintended consequences.</p>
        <p>To restore a reasonable balance between safety and quality of life, they need to take another look at the frequency of required inspections, the duration of shed permits and even the necessity for the sheds in many cases when new construction is not involved. Some financial disincentives, including increasingly steep fees for permit renewals and increasingly steep rent discounts each month the sheds remain, might also prompt owners and contractors to schedule work more efficiently.</p>
