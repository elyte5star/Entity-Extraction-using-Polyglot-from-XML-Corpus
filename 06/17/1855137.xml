        <p>Yun Won Cho was married yesterday to Peter Austin Lyons at the Church of St. Andrew in New York. The Rev. Louis T. Garaventa, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cho, 38, is keeping her name. She is an associate vice president for fund-raising at Rutgers. She graduated cum laude from Yale and received a master's degree in history from the University of California, Los Angeles. She is a daughter of Jong-Wan Cho and Dong-Ik Cho of Basking Ridge, N.J. Her parents retired as the owners of dry-cleaning businesses in Gillette and Warren, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyons, also 38, is a senior real estate manager at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York. He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford. He is a son of Mary Anne Lyons and the late William F. Lyons of New York. His mother is a first-grade teacher at Public School 133 in New York. His father was an executive vice president of Wachovia Securities in New York; he was in charge of American Stock Exchange floor trading and operations.</p>
        <p>The couple met almost 20 years ago through a mutual friend.</p>
        <p>Although they trained for a marathon together in 1998, they weren't much more than acquaintances until October 2004, when they saw each other at a Halloween party. Their first date, almost a year later, was a walk through Central Park to see ''The Gates,'' the installation by Christo, and then a trip to the Metropolitan Museum. ''I thought by being cultural on the first date, I could get a second date,'' Mr. Lyons said.</p>
        <p>Last August, during a training run for a half-marathon in Central Park, Mr. Lyons faked an ankle injury.</p>
        <p>As she leaned over to help, Ms. Cho was floored when Mr. Lyons got to one knee and held up an engagement ring.</p>
        <p>''I had absolutely no idea it was coming,'' she said. ''Who proposes when you're going on a run?''</p>
