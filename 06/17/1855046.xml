        <p>Are you a cannoli lover who thinks the traditional Italian dessert can't be improved on? Then visit Homestyle Desserts Bakery in Peekskill for one of their latest creations.</p>
        <p>Called ''chips and dip,'' the new offering features three kinds of triangular cannoli shell ''chips'' -- powdered sugar, chocolate-covered and chocolate-drizzled -- on a platter with a bowlful of cannoli filling for dipping ($20). The chips are grease-free, crispy and flavorful; the filling is rich, creamy and shot through with chocolate chips. In this presentation,you can balance the flavors the way you want with each bite.</p>
        <p>Chips and dip is just one of the wonderful tastes at this 37-year-old bakery that produces pastries, cookies, cakes (and more) from scratch. Rose Sanca, the owner, uses only real butter and whole eggs, so the products have none of the chemical tastes or flimsy feel of so many other baked goods.</p>
        <p>Part of Homestyle's appeal is the wide variety of desserts it offers. Dozens of cookies ($8.50 to $15 a pound) include German-style rainbows, Jewish hamentaschen and Italian sinfuls -- delicious round nut cookies with powdered sugar on top. Danishes line a wall of cases -- from cheese-filled to éclairs to chocolate horns ($1.25 each). Pies ($10 to $14) range from traditional apple to complex cream and fruit tartes. There are a dozen kinds of cheesecake including basic, tiramisù, chocolate and Key lime, $14 to $22.</p>
        <p>Wedding and specialty cakes make up 33 percent of the business, which is split evenly between wholesale and retail.</p>
        <p>The retail end grew six years ago, when Ms. Sanca was able to double the storefront area. The back bakery grew, too, to about 5,000 feet. But it's coming up with new products that makes this businesswoman happiest. ''I love the creativity of it,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Homestyle Desserts Bakery, 24 South Water Street, Peekskill; information can be found at (914) 737-4659 or at homestyledessertsbakery.com.</p>
