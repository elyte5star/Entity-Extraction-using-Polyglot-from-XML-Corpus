        <p>L. L. Bean in Freeport, Me., has long been a destination for those in search of everything from a fishing rod to flannel sheets. Now, the 95-year-old retailer has plans to lure sports enthusiasts with a nearby outdoor adventure center, where customers will actually be able to try out the equipment (and the sport) before investing in the gear.</p>
        <p>''A kayak is a small amount of money, but it is still nice to try the equipment and have some instruction before you actually make the purchase,'' said Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman for the company.</p>

        <p>The plan, still preliminary, calls for cross-country skiing, a pond for fly-fishing, and a climbing wall, as well as hiking trails on a 700-acre site located a mile from the main store, Ms. Beem said.</p>
