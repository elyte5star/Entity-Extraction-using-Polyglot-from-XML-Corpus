      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Capriccio Cafe is the kind of place where going out for a bite is really about being outside. Sure, this Italian eatery has indoor seating, but a vast majority of the chairs -- more than 80 -- are on Stamford's restaurant row, flanked attractively by a leafy cottonwood on one side and two crabapple trees on the other.</p>
        <p>Still, there's much more to Capriccio than mesh-top tables shaded by oversize umbrellas. A quick perusal of its sprawling menu is all but impossible. Among a dozen antipasti is the recently added involtini di melanzane ($8), consisting of eggplant strips layered and rolled with ricotta, prosciutto and mozzarella. A simple, refreshing rucola salad (also $8), composed of Gorgonzola, pear slices, walnuts, tomato and arugula, is but one of 17 salad options.</p>

        <p>Capriccio Cafe is the kind of place where going out for a bite is really about being outside. Sure, this Italian eatery has indoor seating, but a vast majority of the chairs -- more than 80 -- are on Stamford's restaurant row, flanked attractively by a leafy cottonwood on one side and two crabapple trees on the other.</p>
        <p>Still, there's much more to Capriccio than mesh-top tables shaded by oversize umbrellas. A quick perusal of its sprawling menu is all but impossible. Among a dozen antipasti is the recently added involtini di melanzane ($8), consisting of eggplant strips layered and rolled with ricotta, prosciutto and mozzarella. A simple, refreshing rucola salad (also $8), composed of Gorgonzola, pear slices, walnuts, tomato and arugula, is but one of 17 salad options.</p>
        <p>You'll find nearly 30 selections listed among the panini and grilled flatbreads (from $6.25 to $8.75), and 17 more among the thin-crust pizzas, including the Barese ($8.75), a flavorful mélange of goat cheese, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, grilled chicken and mozzarella over a red sauce. The wild boar ragout ($14) is just one of 13 pasta dishes.</p>
        <p>Compare this abundance of light fare with the entrees -- the menu mentions a mere seven, including a braised lamb shank ($17) -- and one gets the impression that Capriccio is less oriented toward lengthy, multiple-course meals than light dining in an informal setting. Then again, with a dozen coffees available and a score of desserts, you might simply skip ahead and indulge instead in a bit of people-watching over a cup of espresso ($1.75) and a bite of biscotti ($3).</p>
        <p>Capriccio Cafe, 189 Bedford Street, Stamford; (203) 356-9819. Open Sunday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to midnight.</p>
