        <p>I found it interesting that gender was not discussed. School and academics, in the early years especially, are geared more to the activity level of girls. Generally speaking, girls are capable of sitting quietly longer and are more interested in reading and paperwork than boys of the same age. (Of course, there are exceptions.) But carrying this forward to the middle-school years, it is so obvious that girls mature earlier, both physically and socially. I think we'd be doing society a favor by instituting a gender option of starting boys in kindergarten a year later than girls. In reality, with ''redshirting,'' that's what's happening. It's mostly boys who are given an additional year to mature.</p>
