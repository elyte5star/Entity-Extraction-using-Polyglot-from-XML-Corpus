        <p>MARGINALIA: Reviews of Michael Ondaatje's new novel, ''Divisadero,'' have been mixed to positive. But even critics who've admired it -- see Erica Wagner's review on Page 13 -- have found it to be, at times, a slog. (In The Los Angeles Times, Thomas Meaney wrote about the novel's narrator: ''Ondaatje has left us in the hands of an English Ph.D., one whose literary pretensions are on full display.'') ''Divisadero'' is Ondaatje's first novel since ''Anil's Ghost,'' published in 2000. I haven't read ''Anil's Ghost.'' But if I do get around to it, the copy I want is the one advertised by Manchester by the Book, a Massachusetts bookseller. This advance edition of ''Anil's Ghost'' once belonged to John Updike -- who, according to an online ad, covered it with ''notes, marginalia, jottings, writings on over 115 pages in pencil'' while preparing a review for The New Yorker. Someday a young scholar will concoct a not-uninteresting dissertaton on Updike's marginalia. (Note to young scholar: Manchester by the Book sells plenty of other titles he's marked up.) The notes in Updike's edition of ''Anil's Ghost'' are said to include ''skips around, frustrates us, building suspense'' on Page 33, and ''what about his wound?'' on Page 101. Once Updike writes in a book, alas, its price is out of my league. This edition of ''Anil's Ghost'' sells for $1,250. Ondaatje's new novel is No. 18 on the hardcover fiction extended list.</p>
        <p>MIGHTY OATES: What's the best book on tape ever recorded? My vote is for Amanda Plummer's cool, dark telling of Joyce Carol Oates's slim 1992 novel, ''Black Water,'' an updating of the Chappaquiddick story (young woman, old senator, car, water). The story is related by the victim as she's drowning. Plummer's version pulls you right under as well; or at least that's how I felt while listening to it on a long-ago all-night drive. Remembering this 15-year-old audiobook is another way of saying: Joyce Carol Oates writes so many books that you sometimes forget even the good ones. Her new and 36th novel, ''The Gravedigger's Daughter,'' enters the fiction extended list this week at No. 17.</p>
        <p>FACTS, CHECKED: This column has gone out of its way more than once to praise novelists who bother to identify, and when possible to correct, errors that creep into their books. So it was a treat to find out about Barry Eisler's books -- he's a former C.I.A. employee who writes thrillers about a half-Japanese, half-American freelance assassin named John Rain -- and also to discover his Web site. On it, you'll find a detailed, witty ''mistakes'' page that makes you trust everything else he writes all the more. Eisler is willing to suffer for veritas. About one mistake he writes: ''The stun gun Rain uses on Crawley in Chapter 9 of 'Rain Storm (Choke Point)' would not have left marks (I know because I took a fan's advice after the fact and ... that's right, zapped myself with a stun gun. Hurts like hell and leaves welts).'' At other times, Eisler can sound almost dainty: ''In Chapter 36 of 'The Last Assassin,' Delilah says 'Enchantez,' '' he writes. ''This of course should be 'Enchantée' because the word is a feminine adjective, not a verb. Pardonnez-moi.'' D'accord! Eisler's new novel, ''Requiem for an Assassin,'' is No. 26 on the extended fiction list.</p>
