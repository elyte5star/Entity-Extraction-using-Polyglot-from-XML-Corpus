        <p>''For Cavaliers-Spurs, Where Have All the Viewers Gone?'' (June 14) attributes poor viewership of the N.B.A. finals to such elements as the small-market teams involved and NBA.com. One reason not considered is the N.B.A.'s inability to enforce rules with common sense.</p>
        <p>In the 1997 playoffs, Miami's P. J. Brown threw the Knicks' Charlie Ward over his shoulder. After the subsequent melee, the Knicks lost more players than the Heat and the series as well.</p>

        <p>In the Western Conference semifinals this year, San Antonio's Robert Horry body-checked Phoenix's Steve Nash into a table; two Suns players who left the bench were suspended for Game 5.</p>
        <p>The assault of an opposing player has resulted in playoff series victories for the aggressors' team on two occasions. Many fans did not watch the finals because they knew the wrong teams were playing.</p>
