        <p>Editorial urges Campell Soup Co, which is risking its reputation for good citizenship, to reconsider call for city to raze 80-year-old Sears store as condition for improving its headquarters in Camden, NJ</p>

        <p>Ever since 1869, when the fruit merchant Joseph Campbell shook hands on a deal that would establish one of the nation's food giants, the Campbell Soup Company has been a mainstay in Camden, a southern New Jersey city that has long since fallen on hard times.</p>

        <p>Ever since 1869, when the fruit merchant Joseph Campbell shook hands on a deal that would establish one of the nation's food giants, the Campbell Soup Company has been a mainstay in Camden, a southern New Jersey city that has long since fallen on hard times.</p>
        <p>Even as other businesses fled -- Campbell itself shut down a manufacturing plant in 1990 -- the company tried to breathe life into the town. In 1957, it opened a new corporate headquarters there; in 1970, it established the Campbell Museum, and in 1971, it built a new research complex. Long before anyone talked about corporate citizenship, Campbell was among Camden's most upstanding citizens.</p>
        <p>Now, as state and city planners struggle to give the town fresh momentum, the company can once again provide crucial support. Its proposal to spend $72 million to improve its headquarters and lure developers to a proposed adjacent office park would be a tremendous help.</p>
        <p>But the promise comes with a condition that runs counter to the company's well-deserved reputation for staying with Camden in good times and bad. Unless the city razes the 80-year-old Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company store, which Campbell believes would clash with its glistening new headquarters and office park, Campbell says it may leave town altogether. This could severely damage Camden's hopes for a comeback.</p>
        <p>We would urge Campbell to think again before risking its reputation for good citizenship and to explore other courses of action. One alternative would be to draw on the talent of noted architects and preservationists to work this historically significant building into its overall development plans.</p>
        <p>The building, located on a highway about a mile from Camden's downtown, is admittedly in poor shape. Sears left in 1971, and the structure has since been used as a car dealership and offices, and finally by the Camden Housing Authority. It is now vacant, with a hole in the roof and its front door gone. Campbell says it is an impediment to renewal.</p>
        <p>Constructed in the classical revival style, and listed on the state and national historic registries, the building was one of the first stores designed to take advantage of the country's attachment to the automobile. Equipped with a 600-car parking lot, it lured shoppers from throughout South Jersey. Another reason the building is important to preservationists is that many of Camden's other significant buildings, including the Walt Whitman Hotel and several stately houses, have been torn down.</p>
        <p>Campbell says the city should be looking toward its future, not its past, and many New Jersey officials believe that in this situation Campbell holds all the cards. The city, they say, simply cannot take the risk that Campbell and its 1,700 employees and contractors might pick up their marbles and leave.</p>
        <p>That is a risk, but Campbell would suffer a terrible black eye if it left. And it might face a lawsuit if it tore the building down. Campbell could avoid all this trouble by taking a more imaginative approach and blending the old building with the new. One Camden retailer has indicated he would invest $1 million to open a store and offices in the building and says he would like to work with the company.</p>
        <p>Campbell is right when it says Camden must focus on the days ahead. But the city's comeback hopes will be even brighter if it can build on its past glory. After all, Campbell was part of that glory, too.</p>
