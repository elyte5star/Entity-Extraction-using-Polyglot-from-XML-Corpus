        <p>WHEN Lindsay Mathews gets angry, she puts it on a sign.</p>
        <p>In the last four years, she has directed her anger at the war in Iraq by creating some two dozen signs and hanging them outside her home in the Short Beach section.</p>
        <p>''There was a time I got so angry, I put three or four signs up,'' she said. ''They were hanging from the trees.''</p>
        <p>Her neighbors never know which of the carefully worded slogans will appear on Ms. Mathew's picket fence on any given day.</p>
        <p>''I think it's wonderful,'' said Roberto Rivera, 21, who lives down the block and was passing by on a recent afternoon. ''Someone needs to speak up, so I appreciate it.''</p>
        <p>His girlfriend, Nancy Carrasquillo, 20, said, ''We actually talk about them all the time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mathews, 62, an artist, makes the signs, about 4 feet by 3 feet, out of vinyl or other weatherproof materials she buys at fabric and thrift stores. But the real art is in coming up with the words. Ms. Mathews says the trick is being thoughtful without being too provocative. ''It has to fit on a sign,'' she said. ''It has to be understandable, so it's a puzzle.''</p>
        <p>She gets advice from her husband, David Adams, a retired psychology professor who is now a peace activist. ''I think the most effective is 'Bring the Troops Home,' because that speaks to everybody,'' Mr. Adams said.</p>
        <p>The newest sign, in red and green on a white background with a wreath, says, ''All Troops Home by the Holidays.''</p>
        <p>But the couple had second thoughts about others, like ''Iraq, Another Losing Battle'' and ''Blunder Accomplished,'' and took them down as too provocative.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mathews's favorite is ''Good Things Happen When Bad People Let Them,'' which came from a British couple she met in Italy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mathews said people stop by all the time to thank her for the signs, though the reaction hasn't been universally benevolent.</p>
        <p>''I don't agree with her views, but I think it's her right to put up any sign she wants,'' said Joseph Gagliardi, 48, who lives across the street.</p>
        <p>The first banner, ''Average People Opposed to War,'' was stolen, as was its replacement, though a man who often jogged by Ms. Mathews's house returned it. ''One day,'' she said, ''he stopped and he said, 'I have to tell you, I'm going to Iraq or Afghanistan.' ''</p>
        <p>She said it turned out that he was in the National Guard. She never knew his name and hasn't seen him in months.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to end the war, though,'' Ms. Mathews conceded of her sign campaign. ''I know that. I'm doing it for me. I imagine other people get angry. I don't know what they do.''</p>
