        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Cut and Run'' (Op-Ed, June 3), Jon Shure asserts that New Jersey is not well served by the subsidy policies the state employs to attract and retain businesses. Offsets in revenue do not yield promised gains.</p>
        <p>''The better way to build an economy,'' he maintains, is to invest in ''roads, mass transit, schools, worker training,'' which will be ''there to pay dividends long after fickle companies split for the next great deal.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Cut and Run'' (Op-Ed, June 3), Jon Shure asserts that New Jersey is not well served by the subsidy policies the state employs to attract and retain businesses. Offsets in revenue do not yield promised gains.</p>
        <p>''The better way to build an economy,'' he maintains, is to invest in ''roads, mass transit, schools, worker training,'' which will be ''there to pay dividends long after fickle companies split for the next great deal.''</p>
        <p>I agree.</p>
        <p>A regional approach to economic development, moreover, can outwit the contenders at their own game. Neighboring states, counties, cities and communities can plan regionally to attract (and retain) companies that provide employment and generate tax revenues.</p>
        <p>Using tax formulas that don't pit entities against one another but encourage sharing tax revenues can benefit the parts and the whole particularly by investing in the infrastructure to sustain a vibrant economy.</p>
        <p>This is not pie-in-the-sky planning. Other areas in the nation have planned regionally and taxed accordingly.</p>
        <p>Sharing tax revenues, in fact, has led to cooperation on other cross-border issues. New Jersey ought to explore how to make that approach work here.</p>
