        <p>Milestone Tracker  Craig Biggio of the Astros is struggling in his quest for 3,000 hits. He is 11 away, but he hit .250 in April, .231 in May and is hitting .226 this month. Houston will be on the road for nine straight games beginning tomorrow, when it opens a three-game set at the Angels.</p>
        <p>Like Father, Like Son?  Prince Fielder of the Brewers leads the National League in home runs with 24. His father, Cecil Fielder, was the American League leader while with Detroit in 1990 with 51 and tied for the lead with Jose Canseco of the A's in 1991 with 44.</p>
        <p>Helping Himself  Carlos Zambrano of the Cubs hit his second home run of the season last Monday while also picking up his seventh victory. Zambrano has 12 career home runs (in 355 at-bats), second to Mike Hampton of the Braves among active pitchers. Hampton, who has hit 15 (653 at-bats), is on the disabled list and out for the season after elbow surgery.</p>
        <p>Five K Club  Craig Monroe of the Tigers joined Andruw Jones of the Braves as the only other player to strike out five times in a game this season. Monroe did it Thursday against Milwaukee and Jones did it last month against Boston.</p>
        <p>Another Oakland Ace  Dan Haren of the A's leads the American League with a 1.64 earned run average. The last Oakland pitcher to lead the A.L. with an E.R.A. under 2.00 was Vida Blue with a 1.82 in 1971. The A's open a three-game set at home against the Reds tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The Watch List  Pirates shortstop JACK WILSON was on the bench for four consecutive games last week, with some speculating that a lack of hustle on defense had landed him there. After a meeting with team officials, Wilson, right, a former All-Star, played Friday and had hits in his first two at-bats.</p>
        <p>Although DAVID WEATHERS has performed reasonably well as closer for the Reds, his time in the position may be waning as EDDIE GUARDADO, owner of 183 career saves, is on track to return soon. Having been promoted to Class AAA while recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery, Guardado would solidify the Reds' bullpen and allow Weathers to return to his customary eighth-inning role.</p>
        <p>All eyes will be on the Brewers' Yovani Gallardo as he is scheduled to make his major league debut tomorrow against the Giants. Considered among the best pitching prospects in baseball, Gallardo struck out 110 batters in 77 2/3 innings for Class AAA Nashville. His call-up may be short, however, because the injured Chris Capuano is not expected to take more than 15 days to recover from a strained groin muscle.</p>
