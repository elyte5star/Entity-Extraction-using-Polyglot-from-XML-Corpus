        <p>Tom Oreck, the chief executive of the vacuum cleaner maker founded by his father, David, has a whole lot of new floor space to keep clean. The younger Mr. Oreck paid $4.6 million this month for a 7,800-square-foot mansion in Nashville that was once owned by the Grand Ole Opry star Minnie Pearl and her husband, Henry Cannon. The home sits on 4.7 acres near the Tennessee governor's mansion.</p>

        <p>Mr. Oreck said in an interview that although he and his family would move to Nashville, the ''official headquarters of the company is still in New Orleans,'' where his father and his uncle, Marshall, have their offices.</p>
