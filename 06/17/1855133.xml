        <p>Camp-bound kids are choosing sleeping bags and duffels in classic camouflage, with a stylish twist. Quiksilver scrawls its splatter-paint logo across a sleeping bag with an oversize camouflage pattern in camel, chocolate brown and black. Made of nylon with synthetic filler and a flannel lining, it has a matching drawstring carrying bag (far right, $61 at Space Kiddets in New York, 212-420-9878). Paul Frank's rectangular duffel is printed with camouflage cleverly shaped like monkeys; it has a detachable shoulder strap and is large enough to function as a camp trunk (right, $85, also at Space Kiddets). The cool factor of these two pieces has made them early-summer retail sleepers, so get them while they last. As with all things camouflage: now you see 'em, now you don't.</p>
