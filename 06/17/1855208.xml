        <p>TWEAKING TWINKIES</p>
        <p>The News -- Hostess, maker of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and other snacks, has begun offering Twinkies filled with banana crème.</p>
        <p>Behind the News I-- ntroduced in 1930, the sponge snack cake has become part of the national panorama, with more than 500 million sold a year. In 2000, it was included with the Bill of Rights and other items in the National Millennium Time Capsule ''to represent America.'' . Banana crème was used until a banana shortage in the 1940s forced a switch to vanilla filling. Hostess decided to bring it back after banana-crème Twinkies flew off shelves in a limited-time offer.</p>
        <p>LOW ON SYRUP</p>
        <p>The News -- Maple syrup production dropped 13 percent this year to 1.26 million gallons.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Maine was down 25 percent; Vermont, producer of more than one-third of the nation's syrup, was off by 2 percent. Uncooperative weather hurt the sap flow, with New England too cold and other areas too warm. Making matters worse, the sap's sugar content, averaging about 2.5 percent, was lower than usual, requiring more sap to make a gallon of syrup -- about 45 gallons, on average, or 5 gallons more than usual.</p>
        <p>CEREAL CRACKDOWN</p>
        <p>The News -- The Kellogg Company said it would phase out advertisements to children under 12 unless its products meet specific nutritional criteria.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Fruit Loops, beware. The world's largest cereal maker said it would reformulate its foods to reduce calories, sugar, fat and sodium or stop marketing them to children by the end of 2008. About half of the products Kellogg markets to children worldwide exceed the standards. As a result of the new policy, two advocacy groups have agreed not to sue Kellogg over its advertising to children.</p>
        <p>SUGAR ANXIETY</p>
        <p>The News -- The consumption of foods that are low in sugar or sugar free is rising as more consumers worry about sugar levels, a market study found.  Behind the News -- The study by the NPD Group, a market research firm, found that 44 percent of consumers are extremely or very concerned about sugar in their food, the highest level since 1994. Consumers are cutting back as a result. Twenty percent ate low-sugar, sugar-free or artificially sweetened food at least once in a two-week period last year, compared with 14 percent in 2001, according to the study.</p>
        <p>TOUGH TALK</p>
        <p>The News -- A panel of medical experts said children at risk of becoming obese should eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages from their diets.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The recommendation was one of many by an American Medical Association committee on childhood obesity. The panel defined children at risk as having a body-mass index equal or above the 85th percentile but below the 95th, at which a child is obese. Doctors were urged to be frank with patients. ''We need to describe this in medical terms, which is obesity,'' one panel member said.</p>
