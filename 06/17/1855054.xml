        <p>SEVERAL blocks of Springfield Avenue, the main east-west road through this Essex County town of about 24,000, were closed to traffic one sunny Sunday afternoon last month so businesses along the tree-lined thoroughfare could hold a street fair.</p>
        <p>This was a first-time event for a shopping district that is rapidly adding stores that sell everything from skateboards to knitting supplies. Nearly 4,000 people, far more than expected, according to organizers, came even though rain delayed the event a day.</p>
        <p>''I can see the event doubling next year, which makes me kind of nervous, actually,'' said Beth Anne Macdonald, who owns and operates a toy store on the avenue, Wooden You Know, with her husband, Matthew.</p>
        <p>Less than 10 years ago, Springfield Avenue was considered a dreary drag strip by Maplewood's residents. The avenue, a former state road, was the fastest way to get from Union to Irvington but certainly no place to park a car and push a stroller.</p>
        <p>Now, with the help of the Springfield Avenue Partnership, a coalition of businesses and the township government, Springfield Avenue is thriving.</p>
        <p>''I liked the idea of having some kind of commercial aspect around, but unfortunately, it just wasn't very appealing,'' Victor DeLuca, who moved here in 1994 and was mayor from 2001 to 2003, said of the old commercial businesses on the avenue. He was one of those who helped form the partnership in 2001. The township took jurisdiction of the avenue from the state in 2002.</p>
        <p>The partnership pushed for redevelopment of the avenue, which stretches two and a half miles in Maplewood, drawing more than 40 new businesses, particularly restaurants and specialty-food stores. Most of the stores that are part of the special improvement area are locally owned.</p>
        <p>The township, through a grant from the state, tends the streetscape, including planting trees and installing benches. The partnership, through an assessment tax on the businesses, keeps the area clean and conducts advertising and marketing. The assessment, 25 cents on every $100 of property value, is expected to bring in $134,000 in 2007, Mr. DeLuca said.</p>
        <p>Among the new stores are a bead shop, a dance studio, a craft studio and two coffeehouses. The businesses are blending in rather than taking over. ''We're not looking for an outside developer to fix a problem,'' said Ms. Macdonald, who is also the executive director of the partnership.</p>
        <p>The redevelopment got its start on the blocks surrounding the avenue's intersection with Prospect Street, and there is more to come. A police headquarters, a church and two condominium buildings are scheduled to be finished there next year.</p>
        <p>''We get more requests for space in that area than we can accommodate,'' Mr. DeLuca said.</p>
        <p>Maplewood Village, a charming area of shops and restaurants adjacent to the New Jersey Transit railroad station, has long been considered a drawing card for shoppers and businesses. Springfield Avenue, about a mile from the train station, has much more room for new businesses than the village does.</p>
        <p>''The future of Maplewood is tied up in Springfield Avenue,'' said Mayor Fred R. Profeta Jr., a lifelong resident. ''Springfield Avenue is our largest corridor. For many years, it was in decline. It's really, quite frankly, the hottest thing going on in town right now.''</p>
        <p>NetNomads Cafe, a coffee shop, was the first of the new businesses on the avenue to open, in September 2003. Deanne Landress, the owner, moved her shop from Maplewood Village because there was no place to buy a cup of coffee along the avenue, she said.</p>
        <p>''When we moved in there, it was considered very risky,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Landress knew there were enough workers at the existing offices and stores along the avenue to build a good business. As more businesses have opened, she said she has become one of her coffee supplier's top customers. ''Most of these places are owned by mothers and women,'' she said, ''and they're trying to serve the constituents they know the best.''</p>
