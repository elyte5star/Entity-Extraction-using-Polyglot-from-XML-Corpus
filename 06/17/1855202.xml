        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Longtime Emblems of City Roofs, Still Going Strong'' (June 3):</p>
        <p>Another aspect of New York City's iconic water tanks worth considering is their sustainability. They are part of an overall water supply scheme that, in its simplicity, actually offers less expensive, more reliable and ''lower carbon'' solutions to the vital need for water than many cities can claim.</p>
        <p>New York City's gravity-fed system sends water downhill (from Croton hills or the Catskill Mountains) through various aqueducts and pipes, until it arrives under great enough pressure (head) that water generally reaches the sixth floor without being pumped. This system, supplemented by rooftop tanks that store supplies for taller buildings, stood the city in good stead during the 2003 blackout, when most of Gotham's eight million residents never lost water (unlike several other large cities).</p>
        <p>In this era when eco-friendly and disaster-resistant measures have a new relevance, New York's skyline can serve as a reminder of the lasting value of our relatively low-tech (unfiltered, gravity-fed) water supply.</p>
        <p>Patricia Houser  Carmel, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The writer is finishing a dissertation about the history of the city's Croton water supply.</p>
