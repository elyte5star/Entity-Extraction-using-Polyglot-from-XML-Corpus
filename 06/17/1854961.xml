        <p>Gay Pride Week starts Sunday and ends with next Sunday's annual parade, making it easy to spend the entire week taking in gay-theme theater. On Sunday THE NEW YORK NEO-FUTURISTS are presenting the final show in a weekend-long run of ''Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: Super Gay!'' This hyperkinetic troupe's M.O. is a race against the clock to present 30 very short plays --all written by company members, in 60 minutes. Audience members choose the order of the lineup by yelling out choices from a list they've been handed at the door. Standard rules apply this weekend, but the subject matter across the board will be, well, super gay. Sunday at 8 p.m., Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20.</p>
        <p>Ever type your name into the search box in Google just to see what comes up? Citations for people who share your name. Jason Schafer, who wrote for ''Queer as Folk, uses ''ego surfing'' as a jumping-off point for his new play, ''I GOOGLE MYSELF.'' In it, a gay pornographic star, a stoner-mechanic-poet and a stalker share a common name in this production by Theater Askew that poses the question: How far might one go to be a top search term on Google? In previews, opens on Thursday, Under St. Marks, 94 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $18.</p>
        <p>Beginning Tuesday the NATIVE ALIENS THEATER COLLECTIVE will present its eighth annual series of original short plays about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. ''Short Stories 8: Urban View,'' will feature eight plays, chosen by the company's nine-member board from more than 100 submissions. Tuesday through Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., the Independent, 52-A West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door.</p>
