        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''We Don't Need 169 Fiefs'' (editorial, May 13):</p>
        <p>Moving toward reducing the tax burden for all cities and towns is an excellent idea whose time has come. Regional governments could be successful only if other measures were included; for example, many of us have noticed the scramble for new or replacement superintendents of schools throughout Connecticut. There are 165 school districts in Connecticut, all of which have their own superintendent of schools; they vary from a school population of about 5,000 to 25,000, but the jobs are very similar. Salaries range from less than $100,000 to more than $200,000 depending on the location, size and challenge of the system.</p>
        <p>But let's also look at similar other positions in each of Connecticut's 169 towns: each town has a registrar of vital statistics, city clerk, treasurer or finance officer, two registrars of voters, planning and zoning officer, public works director -- the list goes on, 169 of each.</p>
        <p>It is time to address this as a major problem. The entire state of Connecticut is smaller than some single districts in other states operating with only 1/169 of the number of municipal positions. Imagine the cost savings to the towns and cities if we had only one-fifth the number of superintendents of schools, registrars, inspectors, chiefs and so on? That's real and permanent tax savings; locally elected boards could still have local input, but by joining together with other nearby towns, in a regional system, life would be made more tolerable for all.</p>
        <p>If the Legislature is really serious about addressing the high real estate tax burden, this just might be the answer.</p>
