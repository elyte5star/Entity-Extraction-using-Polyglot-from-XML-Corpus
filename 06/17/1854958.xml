        <p>The same story can be told, or danced, many ways. That is one reason the ballet can be so exciting. AMERICAN BALLET THEATER may be especially exciting this week because it is entirely devoted to Kenneth MacMillan's version of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Many of the company's stars will take their turns as the tragically star-crossed lovers. Among the performances of note: the American ballerina GILLIAN MURPHY makes her New York debut as Juliet, DAVID HALLBERG as her Romeo on Wednesday, and the Italian dancer ALESSANDRA FERRI gives her final performance with the company on Saturday night, with ROBERTO BOLLE, a guest artist also from Italy. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Wednesday and Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org, $24 to $110.</p>
        <p>Portraying Romeo and Juliet is probably a common dream for the young dancers participating in this year's NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL BALLET COMPETITION. The hopefuls, who represent 17 countries, will present pas de deux in the first of four public performances on Wednesday night. The rounds continue through Saturday, and an international jury will hand out awards at a gala next Sunday. Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m., June 24 at 7 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, nyibc.org; $29, $19 students and 65+ on Wednesday through Saturday, $71.50 for the gala.</p>
        <p>SAVION GLOVER knows innumerable ways to make tap-dancing an always fresh and often surprising art. And with subtle changes in rhythm, timbre and dynamics, he will once again transform his tapping feet into a whole ensemble of percussion instruments in performances at the Joyce from Tuesday through July 14. Tuesday, Thursday and Fruday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday and Saturday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44.</p>
