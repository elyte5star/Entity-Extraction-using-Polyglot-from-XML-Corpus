        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re: ''A Sense of Anxiety a Shirt Won't Cover'' by Alex Kuczynski (Thursday Styles, June 14):</p>
        <p>As a plastic surgeon with a subspecialty in gynecomastia, I am dismayed at the tenor of your article.</p>
        <p>It is made to appear as if young men with this problem are simply fat or vain and seeking an easy way out. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have operated on more than 1,300 men, including more than 70 adolescent boys, with this problem, and most of them were of normal weight.</p>
        <p>Their stories are all remarkably similar: teasing and taunting during teenage years, refraining from sports, reluctance in intimate situations and -- in some cases -- deliberately gaining weight because obesity is unfortunately more tolerated in this country than men with enlarged breasts.</p>
        <p>To date, absolutely none of my patients has had a regrowth of breast tissue. And my experience runs contrary to the medical opinions that the problem will disappear just by waiting it out. Too many of my 20-something-year-olds did just that. They waited in vain during their precious adolescence for the problem to resolve itself -- and it didn't.</p>
        <p>And it is during these years, when self-esteem, ego and self-confidence are being built, that these boys are teased and retreat into a shell. I have witnessed remarkable changes in these boys' personality once this burden has been literally and figuratively lifted off their chest.</p>
