        <p>Times have certainly changed since the days of ''Leave It to Beaver,'' when Ward Cleaver, in a business suit, won the bread and June Cleaver, in an apron, served it. But we are far from being a ''Mr. Mom'' society, too.</p>
        <p>In 62 percent of married-couple families with children under 18, both the father and the mother are employed, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A sizable 31 percent adhere to the traditional '60s sitcom mold, with the father being the sole wage earner.</p>
        <p>A mere 5 percent of the fathers are not working while the mother is employed, the data show. The statistics are silent on which of these fathers are jobless by choice.</p>
        <p>But it is clear that the urge to earn remains strong among fathers, and that a man's ego may suffer a blow if he decides to stay home.</p>
        <p>In response, Web sites like athomedad.com have emerged to help this group endure its share of snickers and stigma. ''Men who change diapers,'' the site proudly proclaims, ''change the world.''</p>
