        <p>LIKE the number of bedrooms or proximity to parks, quality of schools is a factor that can make or break a decision on whether to plunk down a small fortune on a house.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, then, towns with blue-ribbon public school systems -- like Greenwich, Fairfield and West Hartford -- have consistently commanded some of the higher home prices in the state.</p>
        <p>But prices within a town can fluctuate, even by neighborhood, based on the strength of the local elementary school, according to a new study by seven professors and students at Trinity College.</p>
        <p>The study examined the relationship between grade-school test scores and home prices in West Hartford's 11 elementary school districts, and found that as one climbed, so did the other, in specific and predictable increments.</p>
        <p>In fact, every 12-percentage-point difference in scores on the Connecticut Mastery Tests, the standardized exams that students in Grades 3 through 8 take every year, is worth $5,065 to those buying or selling a home, according to the study, called ''School Choice in Suburbia: Public School Testing and Private Real Estate Markets.''</p>
        <p>''I'd suspected that the public school market and the private real estate market had been closely tied,'' said Jack Dougherty, an associate professor of education studies at Trinity and one of the study's authors. ''Now, I have more evidence that, at least in the pre-eminent suburbs, that's definitely the case.''</p>
        <p>The study looked at 8,736 home sales between 1996 and 2005, and a tricky alphabet soup of models and analyses to allow an apples-to-apples comparison, but it did not try to explain the trend. Mr. Dougherty said he would tackle that in a future study.</p>
        <p>The study's research reveals what seems like contradictory information, since fewer than 35 percent of homeowners who were interviewed admitted to actively parsing test scores before signing deeds.</p>
        <p>Still, the Internet has allowed the grouping of test scores that were not even collected in a central state location until 1992, and gathering them in one easily accessible place means that just one person and word of mouth can be powerful influences.</p>
        <p>Indeed, more than half the respondents in the study said they rely on ''social networks of family, friends, and co-workers for school quality information.''</p>
        <p>That information can reveal, for example, that in 2006, 99 percent of the fourth-graders at the Lloyd H. Bugbee School scored at or above proficiency in math, while 93 percent scored at that level in reading and 87 percent in writing, according to a state-run database, cmtreports.com.</p>
        <p>In comparison, students at the Whiting Lane School, whose district abuts Bugbee's, scored perceptibly lower the same year, even if it is still considered a strong school.</p>
        <p>In 2006, 87 percent of fourth-graders at Whiting Lane scored at or above proficiency in math. In reading, 66 percent achieved that level, and in writing, it was 68 percent.</p>
        <p>By the logic of the study, then, these performance gaps should translate into tens of thousands of dollars in price differences. They do, as the Bugbee homes routinely fetch far higher prices than the Whiting Lane properties.</p>
        <p>On the surface, though, these two districts can seem like mirror images of each other. They are both lined with center-hall Colonials built in the 1920s, and are often separated by one street, like South Quaker Lane, which forms a border.</p>
        <p>For their part, West Hartford brokers are aware of the trend but can't perpetuate it under the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968, which makes it illegal to use school data to steer would-be home buyers.</p>
        <p>But these days, when clients show up, they already have school preferences, said John Lepore, a sales associate with Prudential Connecticut Realty, who has been selling homes in West Hartford for two decades.</p>
        <p>''We don't get too involved, because we can't,'' he said. ''But buyers are much savvier now than they were 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Still, brokers do exercise considerable power on the other side of the equation, helping sellers set prices based on variables like school reputations, according to brokers and education advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>''The information is in the marketplace on one side of the transaction or the other,'' said Alex Johnston, the executive director of the Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now, a two-year-old group whose mission is to close the academic achievement gap in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Making it worse is that top-ranked school districts are often available only to those students who can afford to live there. ''Geography,'' Mr. Johnston said, ''shouldn't be the driver of access to a quality public education.''</p>
