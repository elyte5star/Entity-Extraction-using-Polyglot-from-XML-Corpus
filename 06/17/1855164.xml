        <p>BELOW ground, on the subway platform for the No. 1 train at Lincoln Center, Martin Jennings -- ''Serious Music Man,'' as his business card declares -- is preparing for his 10:23 p.m. performance. An Englishman in his mid-40s, he readies himself, his aluminum music stand holding a complete score of Sergei Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' not the standard subway saxophonist's fare. Mr. Jennings, who is tall and dark-haired, wears a red velvet jacket; he keeps time on the tenor sax with the tap of a black Oxford.</p>
        <p>At the exit closest to Lincoln Center, he begins, timing his performances to the moment when the Metropolitan Opera lets out or, as on this night, the New York City Ballet. He tries to play almost every evening there is a performance. It is an exercise in adaptation; he learns first what is on the schedule for the evening, and then how to play it.</p>

        <p>BELOW ground, on the subway platform for the No. 1 train at Lincoln Center, Martin Jennings -- ''Serious Music Man,'' as his business card declares -- is preparing for his 10:23 p.m. performance. An Englishman in his mid-40s, he readies himself, his aluminum music stand holding a complete score of Sergei Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' not the standard subway saxophonist's fare. Mr. Jennings, who is tall and dark-haired, wears a red velvet jacket; he keeps time on the tenor sax with the tap of a black Oxford.</p>
        <p>At the exit closest to Lincoln Center, he begins, timing his performances to the moment when the Metropolitan Opera lets out or, as on this night, the New York City Ballet. He tries to play almost every evening there is a performance. It is an exercise in adaptation; he learns first what is on the schedule for the evening, and then how to play it.</p>
        <p>A classically trained musician, Mr. Jennings taught himself the overture from Gluck's ''Orpheus and Eurydice'' and picked up countless other scores on the fly. For the past five years, he has made his living thanks to dollar bills dropped by Lincoln Center's homeward-bound concertgoers and balletgoers, who leave money in his instrument case to show their appreciation for a musical nightcap.</p>
        <p>This evening, ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Its audience filters in, clutching programs, and when they hear the music, their eyes soften as they realize that this stranger is performing the very strains still playing in their heads.</p>
        <p>''Oh, my God,'' a middle-aged man in a blazer and tie whispers to his wife, who is wearing an elegant black dress. ''He's playing 'Romeo and Juliet!' '' They linger, listening to the stern, brooding elegance of ''The Dance of the Knights,'' its brutal crescendo and dramatic turns suggesting that the Montagues and Capulets might just follow them home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings stops as a train rattles by, and looks about him. ''I hope you enjoyed my rendition,'' he mumbles. ''I am a professional musician. Please be generous.'' He trails off halfheartedly, then puts the mouthpiece back to his lips.</p>
        <p>Although his performance is a pleasure for his audience, it is stifling underground this summery evening, and to Mr. Jennings, this is still a job. His talents far outmatch his concert hall. ''It's hard, very touch and go,'' he says. ''You never know when the train's going to come.''</p>
        <p>An express thunders through on the middle track, and when the No. 1 local clatters in, it carries off with it great swaths of his audience, until finally, everyone is gone. Mr. Jennings sighs, then abandons the Prokofiev for improvised jazz.</p>
