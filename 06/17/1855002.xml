        <p>A CAMPAIGN begun in March to attract New Englanders to tourist-related businesses on the North Fork with discounts at wineries and restaurants and on the Cross Sound Ferry has been extended through the summer, organizers say.</p>
        <p>To attract visitors from New England, 15 wineries offered discounts on wine purchases or free wine tasting to those who showed a special voucher they received on the ferry. Discounts were offered also at certain restaurants.</p>
        <p>''By continuing this program, I suspect we will double or triple the number of folks we see from New England,'' said Robert Kern, general manager of Martha Clara Vineyards in Riverhead.</p>
        <p>Stanley Mickus, director of marketing and public relations for the Cross Sound Ferry, said that more than 1,000 carloads of people from New England took advantage of discounted ferry tickets for the trip from New London, Conn., to Orient Point from March 22 through June 1. The round-trip promotional fare was $55 for a car carrying up to six people, compared with the regular one-way fare of $44 for a car and driver.</p>
        <p>''The numbers exceeded our expectations,'' Mr. Mickus said. ''We think a majority of the people were new visitors to the North Fork.''</p>
        <p>The campaign, paid for by the Cross Sound Ferry and a grant from the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, has spent about $30,000, he said.</p>
        <p>Steven L. Bate, executive director of the Long Island Wine Council, an industry association, said the campaign was begun during what is traditionally a slower period for North Fork businesses. ''The season doesn't kick off until after Memorial Day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To further promote the North Fork's more than 40 wine producers, Mr. Bate said the Long Island Wine Council ''had a strong presence'' earlier this year at the Boston Wine Expo, an international trade show.</p>
        <p>''The New England market is a natural target market for us, and our partnership with the Cross Sound Ferry is a key part of our marketing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kern said the effort to encourage residents of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to visit the North Fork was ''similar to what this region did 25 years ago when we marketed ourselves to western Long Island.''</p>
