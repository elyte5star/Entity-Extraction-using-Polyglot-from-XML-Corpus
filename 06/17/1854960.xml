        <p>In March fans eagerly awaiting the new ANIMAL COLLECTIVE album (''Strawberry Jam,'' due in September) got something else instead: ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), a spectacular solo CD from PANDA BEAR, one of the Animals. It might be the sweetest album yet to emerge from Animal Collective's gently discombobulated universe, a sunny collection of fractured ballads and exuberant splintered jam sessions. (Animal Collective fans, be honest: If someone had told you this was the band's new album, would you have known the difference?)</p>
        <p>This week Panda Bear embarks on an abbreviated United States tour. On Monday he is scheduled to play at the Bowery Ballroom; then, after shows in Philadelphia and his native Baltimore, he returns to the Bowery Ballroom on Saturday for the last of the four solo shows. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out.</p>
        <p>Also on Monday night: the New York stop on the TRUE COLORS TOUR, organized to combat discrimination and to ''raise public awareness about the issues facing the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.'' The lineup is an appealing mishmash: the American pop veterans Cyndi Lauper and Debbie Harry alongside the British pop veterans in Erasure; the spiky cabaret-punk duo the Dresden Dolls; the M.C. tag team of Margaret Cho and Rosie O'Donnell; and, maybe best of all, the dance-punk trio the Gossip, led by the bluesy yawper Beth Ditto. Though she's from Arkansas, she has become a rock star in Britain; expect her to act like one. Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $51 to $205.50.</p>
