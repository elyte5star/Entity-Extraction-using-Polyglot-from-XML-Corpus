        <p>Confident he was going to show me something spectacular, Aubrey Lindley grinned. Then, he carefully unwrapped a sample of very bittersweet chocolate and offered me the small pieces almost reverentially, as if they were sapphires.</p>
        <p>The chocolate was made by a local artisan, Steven Lawrence. It was a little ''rustic'' -- a bit rougher in texture and more complex in flavor than traditional chocolate --and sublime.</p>
        <p>With about a dozen artisanal chocolate shops, you'd think Portland, Ore., needs a new one as much as it needs more rain. But Jesse Manis's and Mr. Lindley's shop, Cacao, where chocolate prêt-à-porter meets chocolate haute couture just outside the Pearl District, is getting rave reviews. Recently, Hedi Slimane, a French fashion designer, stopped in. He praised the drinking chocolate. The next day he returned for more. Lovers of French chocolates, Jesse and Aubrey considered this high praise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manis spent 10 years immersed in chocolate working for Fran's, a Seattle chocolatier. The chocolate bug rubbed off on Mr. Lindley, and the two opened their shop last September. The walls of the spacious store (kept at 66 degrees to preserve the goods), are painted in soothing colors -- '50s-ish sea foam and milk chocolate. Cafe tables are scattered in front. There cocoa fiends, like Mr. Slimane, can sample one of the three kinds of drinking chocolate ($2 a shot). The chocolate with chili had a particularly fine kick.</p>
        <p>One mission of the store is to bring respect to the chocolate bar. It offers a selection from up to 35 producers of the world's best. Eyes are drawn, for instance, to the Easter-egg-colored pyramidal packages of Pralus bars from France ($48 for a collection of 10).</p>
        <p>Confections like truffles, caramels and pralines are displayed like pinned butterflies in a glass case. Try the chocolate-covered ginger discs from Fran's, or the fig and fennel truffles, from Theo's, also in Seattle, both from $2 a piece.</p>
        <p>Cacao, 414 SW 13th Avenue, Portland, Ore., (503) 241-0656; www.cacaodrinkchocolate.com.</p>
