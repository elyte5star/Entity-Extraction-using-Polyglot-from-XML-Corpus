        <p>CHANGE is difficult. In politics, perhaps the most recent example is New Jersey's almost tortuous march to so-called ''clean elections'' by trying to provide public funds for state legislative races in exchange for limits on campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>The state began testing this approach with races in two legislative districts in 2005. After an inauspicious beginning when just one of five candidates in those two districts had actually qualified for public financing, the stage is set for a retooled experiment this election year.</p>
        <p>This time, candidates are eligible for public financing in legislative races in three districts -- the 14th in Mercer and Middlesex, the 37th in Bergen and the 24th in Sussex and Morris.</p>
        <p>But even this small expansion, put together by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, which is reluctant to give up its fund-raising edge in the state, is considered by some a far cry from real change.</p>
        <p>Of the three designated districts in this campaign cycle, two are considered safe districts for each of the major parties and the one district that is considered to have a competitive race is not that competitive after all. So it can't be a real test for what can happen in a contest when big money is removed from the election equation.</p>
        <p>William E. Schluter, the former Republican state senator who has led the call for campaign financing during the last decade, points out that the experiment is irrelevant because it does not include primary elections. In a state with so many safe Republican and Democratic districts, the primary is often the real battleground.</p>
        <p>Under the rules of this year's test, candidates can raise up to $10,000 in donations statewide of no more than $500 each but then must get 400 to 800 individual contributions from registered voters in the district of no more than $10 each. Then major party candidates are eligible for public funds up to the amount equal to the average expended in the district's last two elections.</p>
        <p>If this year's experiment needed a poster child it would probably be Assemblyman Bill Baroni, the Republican candidate for State Senate in the 14th District. He is running against Seema M. Singh, a Democrat who is a former ratepayer advocate, for an open seat.</p>
        <p>''The process forces candidates to go out and talk with small groups in order to raise the qualifying money,'' said Mr. Baroni, who is attending dozens of kaffeeklatsches in the homes of friends and supporters in the district to raise the individual $10 donations. ''It empowers me as a candidate and it empowers people at the small fund-raisers to talk about issues.''</p>
        <p>At a friend's recent wedding, Mr. Baroni said, he had to turn down donations from scores of his friends who wanted to contribute to his campaign. ''It felt great,'' Mr. Baroni said with uncharacteristic brio for a political candidate. He said that within a week or so he expected to have raised enough $10 contributions to qualify for the experiment's public financing. Under the terms of the test he would receive about $300,000.</p>
