        <p>The New Britain Museum of American Art is displaying more than 65 eyebrow-torching paintings and sculptures by California artists this summer.</p>

        <p>''Believe me, there has never been anything quite like this around here before,'' said Paula Bender, communications and marketing manager for the New Britain Museum of American Art. She was referring to the museum's major summer exhibition, ''California in Connecticut: The Joanne and William Rees Collection,'' on view in its temporary upstairs exhibition galleries.</p>
        <p>The show certainly brightens up the place, for this collection of more than 65 paintings and sculptures by artists from the San Francisco Bay area and other Northern California towns is ablaze with eyebrow-torching color. It is like a little piece of California in Connecticut, timed appropriately to coincide with the warmer months.</p>
        <p>The collection belongs to Joanne and William Rees, a New Haven couple who have passionately purchased work by California artists for the past 25 years. With the assistance of John Fitz Gibbon, an art historian and critic, they began assembling their collection in the early 1980s, focusing on the work of young, lesser-known, more affordable artists.</p>
        <p>There is a consistency of style to the works in the show, most of which are figurative, colorful paintings of ordinary things: bouquets of flowers, garden scenes, people at the beach or in a restaurant. The paintings are often satirical in design, gently mocking their subjects in a messy, ironic or humorous manner. Some art world denizens may resist their frivolity, but the upshot is a focused selection of paintings that are basically fun to look at.</p>
        <p>Instantly putting a smile on your face is Joan Brown's ''At the Beach'' (1973), a large painting of a group of women having a glass of wine after a day at the beach. To the right is a male figure in outline form; he appears to be sleeping, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The women are huddled loosely together talking, perhaps laughing at their worn-out male companion.</p>
        <p>Most of these artists are little known outside California, though a handful have national reputations. Among the better known are Robert Arneson, Roy De Forest and William T. Wiley, all of whom were associated with Funk, an informal art movement of offbeat, sensuous, direct narrative painting that flourished in Northern California in the late 1960s and early '70s.</p>
        <p>Funk was influenced by early-20th-century modern anti-art movements like Dada. But its origins are also in popular culture, the artists seeking inspiration from television, advertising and the movies rather than art history. Mr. Wiley made exotic assemblages using unusual materials and found objects, while Mr. Arneson famously made a glazed ceramic toilet, and other humorous objects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arneson's ceramics and some watercolors on display here are not among his very best work. Similarly, several works by Mr. Wiley are good but not outstanding, with the exception of his ''Targets for Ms. Chief'' (1980). It is one of the most thrilling works in the show, depicting a scruffy, abstract maze of indecipherable shapes and forms. Part of the pleasure is the sheer puzzlement of its meaning.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Forest's paintings depict crowded, psychedelic environments of bizarre-looking plants, birds and anthropomorphic animals, the surfaces often enhanced with areas of heavily textured, pointed dots made of thick dollops of paint. His paintings also stubbornly resist easy interpretation. Showing here is ''Summer at the Seaside'' (1981), an absurd yet surprisingly elegant painting that seems to grow on you the longer you look at it.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Forest was one of the more consistently interesting of the Funk artists -- he exhibited regularly in commercial galleries for more than 50 years, and in 1975 a retrospective of his works was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. He was also one of the last of the group -- he died in May in Vallejo, Calif., just a few weeks after the opening of the present show.</p>
        <p>Other artists whose work is hanging here include Robert Brady, Donald Hazlitt, David J. Gilhooly, James Albertson, William Allan and Lance Richbourg. In 1983, Mr. Richbourg was commissioned to paint a portrait of the Rees family. He depicts them, with slightly old-fashioned formality, assembled in front of Ms. Brown's painting ''At the Beach.'' For a family of collectors so fixated on paintings filled with fun, energy and color, it's no surprise that what's most striking about this image is its optimistic pathos. They all look very happy and content.</p>
        <p>''California in Connecticut: The Joanne and William Rees Collection,'' New Britain Museum of American Art, 56 Lexington Street, New Britain. Through July 3. Information: (860) 229-0257 or nbmaa.org.</p>
