        <p>WEARING a safety harness around her waist, Patti DiMenna, 39, scrambled up a 32-foot ladder and onto a suspended platform.</p>
        <p>Grabbing onto a bar, she flew through the air with the greatest of ease, a daring stay-at-home mom on a flying trapeze.</p>
        <p>Maybe there was just a hint of trepidation as she hooked her legs up over the bar and swung upside down in midair. Not to mention a bit of shakiness when she plopped, buttocks first, into the safety net 10 feet above the ground and somersaulted to the mat below.</p>
        <p>''I am doing a lot for my body and my mind, and spiritually it is good,'' Ms. DiMenna said breathlessly, once she was back on terra firma. ''It makes you feel like you can accomplish anything you want.''</p>
        <p>Besides, for toning the abs and building core strength, it beats crunches, she said.</p>
        <p>''I hate doing sit-ups,'' added Ms. DiMenna, who lives in St. James.</p>
        <p>She still goes to a gym. But like many of the other people who take weekly flying acrobatic lessons at I.FLY, a flying trapeze and aerial arts school here, Ms. DiMenna has made swinging from a trapeze rig part of her workout routine.</p>
        <p>''It gives you stamina,'' she said. ''It makes you feel good.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DiMenna was one of the first to sign up last August, when Marco and Anthony Rosamilia, brothers from Franklin Square who had worked in the circus arts and flying trapeze programs at Club Med resorts in Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean, opened the center on the campus of the Ivy League School and camp in Smithtown. This year the training is being offered from April through October.</p>
        <p>While many of the lessons are for children, ages 4 and up, the program also has workshops for adults. Marco Rosamilia said about 1,200 students had participated in the program since it began last August, two-thirds of them children. Of the roughly 400 adults, about 70 percent are women, he said. Lessons begin at $40 for 90 minutes, which includes about a half-dozen trips up the ladder to fly.</p>
        <p>Laura Schoeneman, 24, a bartender from Farmingdale, works out on the trapeze twice a week.</p>
        <p>''The more you learn to do, the more muscles you use, the more you tone,'' said Ms. Schoeneman, who has posted videos of her flying workouts on YouTube. ''It works out everything -- your core, your arms, your legs. It's a little more exciting than Pilates.''</p>
        <p>There are other benefits. Some adults learn to conquer fears on the trapeze, said Mr. Rosamilia, 30.</p>
        <p>He stands on the perch, holding the students by the back of the safety harness, encouraging them to curl their toes over the edge of the platform, thrust their hips out and hurtle their bodies into the air.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosamilia claimed that upper-body strength was not a requirement, and that anyone could learn to fly. No students have been injured, he said. (Everyone must sign a waiver absolving the school from responsibility for injuries.) Anthony Rosamilia, 28, works as the spotter, controlling the safety wires from the ground.</p>
        <p>Lisa Fritz, 37, of Bellmore, used to be terrified of heights and falling, she said. But when her son, James, 9, panicked on the aerial platform last summer, Ms. Fritz, a coordinator for a travel insurance company, decided she would climb up and show him how to do it.</p>
        <p>''I have never been so scared in my whole life,'' Ms. Fritz recalled. When she grabbed the bar and stepped off the platform, she closed her eyes and screamed.</p>
        <p>However, she said, ''Once you get past the initial fear of when you first come off the board, it is such an exhilarating experience that it just pulls you in.'' On her third swing she did a knee hang.</p>
        <p>''I have been addicted ever since,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Fritz, going to the gym just isn't as much fun.</p>
        <p>''I never got that adrenaline rush,'' she said.</p>
