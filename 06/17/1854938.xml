        <p>I am thinking about a visit to Sicily with my wife and kids (5 and 8). We've been to Italy, but not Sicily. We are thinking about spending a week in Taormina in a villa outside the city. I'd appreciate any thoughts. -- Bob Bertino, Duxbury, Mass.</p>
        <p>Several contributors to the Travel section have weighed in on the merits of Sicily, and Taormina in particular. Danielle Pergament, who recently wrote about Palermo (''In Palermo, Life Vibrates in a Fading Market''), says the hillside town of Taormina is her favorite place on the island, describing it as stunning but very touristy.</p>
        <p>Frederika Randall, who wrote the ''Baroque Side of Sicily'' in 2003, says Taormina is the most elegant place to stay in Sicily and, arguably, south of the Amalfi coast. She agrees that it can be overrun with visitors but still thinks it is a good place for children -- with ancient ruins to explore nearby, excellent beaches accessible just below the town and proximity to the smoldering, yet currently nonthreatening Mount Etna. Ms. Randall recommends a day trip to the Roman villa near Piazza Armerina.</p>
        <p>You'll also find some great Taormina-specific recommendations by the Italian fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana in Horatio Silva's T: Travel magazine piece from September 2005, ''A Sicilian Slice,'' available free from the Times travel archives at nytimes.com/travel. The two like to go clubbing in town, which may not be what you're looking for, and for dinner they recommend Gambero Rosso and Il Baccanale, then BAM Bar for granita (flavored crushed ice) and Pasticceria Minotauro near Etna for Sicilian cannoli with an ''unbelievable'' view of the volcano.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pergament also recommends the hotel where she stayed, the Palazzo San Domenico (Piazza San Domenico 5; 39-0942-613111; www.sandomenico.thi.it), which she describes as ''one of the nicest hotels in Italy, if not Europe.'' With standard doubles from 280 euros ($386 at $1.38 to the euro) this time of year, it's not cheap, but perhaps worth the splurge if you want a luxury break from the villa.</p>
