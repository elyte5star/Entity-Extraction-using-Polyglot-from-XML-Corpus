        <p>ON a drizzling Sunday morning last month, Adrienne Pincus hit the brakes on her bicycle as two riders -- one a close friend -- crashed on a rain-slicked road in Norwalk, Conn., near the start of the Bloomin' Metric, one of region's most popular cycling events.</p>
        <p>By the time Mrs. Pincus, 46, of White Plains, had stopped, her friend was lying in the road. Her helmet had flown off, and her head had hit the pavement so hard that blood soon began to ooze from both ears.</p>
        <p>It was 8:36 a.m., and Mrs. Pincus immediately dialed 911 on her cellphone. But instead of going to the police in Norwalk, her wireless signal hit a cell tower about 15 miles across the Long Island Sound, in the North Shore hamlet of Greenlawn, N.Y., then was directed even farther away, to the Suffolk County police in Yaphank.</p>
        <p>The emergency complaint officer there told Mrs. Pincus that she could not help her because the call had come from outside Suffolk's jurisdiction, according to interviews with Mrs. Pincus and the authorities in Suffolk. The officer suggested that Mrs. Pincus dial ''0'' to reach an operator to connect her to 911.</p>
        <p>''I was furious,'' Mrs. Pincus said. ''I pleaded with her to be transferred to Connecticut. There were two riders down, bleeding and unconscious. It was a real emergency.''</p>
        <p>Another rider called the Bloomin' Metric emergency line, and the Norwalk police were alerted at 8:41 a.m., five minutes after Mrs. Pincus's 911 call. An ambulance was on the scene eight minutes later, and it arrived at Norwalk Hospital at 9:03 a.m., according to a hospital spokeswoman, Maura Romaine.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pincus's friend, who asked that her name not be used, broke her skull, jaw and collarbone and required emergency brain surgery, according to the woman's sister. She returned to her home in Westchester last Tuesday. The other cyclist sustained scrapes in the fall, but was able to walk away.</p>
        <p>That episode, on May 20, exposed the intricacies and technological challenges facing the metropolitan region's enhanced 911 system as the authorities field calls from wireless phones whose signals do not follow state or county boundaries.</p>
        <p>It also pointed out flaws in Suffolk County's response to out-of-state 911 calls. While the Suffolk police routinely transfer calls from Nassau County back to the Nassau police, they had no protocol in place to transfer calls from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pincus said she was so incensed by Suffolk's response that a few days after the incident, she sent letters to the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, and Senators Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Charles E. Schumer of New York.</p>
        <p>On June 4, the Suffolk authorities announced a new policy in which a cellphone call from Connecticut would be transferred to the Connecticut State Police, who would then find the proper department to handle the call.</p>
        <p>''Now our officers will have those Connecticut numbers in front of them,'' said Lt. Mark Fisher, a Suffolk County Police Department spokesman. ''When it's life or death, we have to move as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>The region's 911 systems have developed over the past decade to keep pace with the growth in wireless phone use and developments in phone technology. Wireless signals, which are radio waves, are picked up by one of the thousands of wireless antennas in the region, and Connecticut, New York and New Jersey have their own systems to handle emergency calls.</p>
        <p>While Connecticut and New Jersey have statewide systems, the one in New York is set up on a county-by-county basis.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, for example, there are more than 1,500 cell towers that direct wireless 911 calls to 1 of 107 public safety answering points, said George J. Pohorilak, director of the state's Office of Statewide Emergency Telecommunications.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has 210 answering points, while Suffolk County has 12. Westchester has just one answering point for its wireless 911 calls -- the Hudson Valley Transportation Management Center in Hawthorne, operated by the New York State Police.</p>
        <p>Each cell tower has multiple antenna faces, so it is able to pick up wireless signals emanating from different directions. Each face is then programmed to send 911 calls back to the jurisdiction from which the wireless call came from.</p>
        <p>''It can get tricky,'' Mr. Pohorilak said. ''We have to make a decision on every antenna as to where we send the 911 calls.''</p>
        <p>Geography, and the nature of wireless radio signals, makes it less than an exact science. New Jersey 911 centers routinely receive calls from across the Hudson in Westchester or across the Delaware River at the Pennsylvania border.</p>
        <p>While Suffolk authorities say they rarely get a Connecticut call, Westchester routinely receives calls from Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, said a New York State Police spokesman, Lt. Glenn R. Miner.</p>
        <p>''The calls are generally along the border; we query the caller about where they are, and we have one-button contact that lets us transfer the calls,'' he said. ''It's a direct connection, and it's seamless.''</p>
        <p>State 911 systems are paid for through monthly surcharges on wireless phones and landlines. New Yorkers pay the most, with callers charged $1.20 a month per wireless phone and counties able to add 30 cents a month. Westchester and Nassau Counties are among 40 New York counties that do so, said James A. Denn, a spokesman for the New York State Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>Connecticut wireless owners pay 40 cents a month a line, while New Jersey customers pay 90 cents a line.</p>
        <p>If a caller is visiting an area and does not know where he or she is, new technology can help 911 operators locate the caller through Phase 2 systems, which are in place throughout the region.</p>
        <p>Wireless phones from Verizon, Nextel and Sprint have chips that link the devices to Global Positioning System satellites, so a caller's location will come up on a 911 dispatcher's computer screen.</p>
        <p>But that system has its limitations because G.P.S. signals sometimes have difficulty penetrating buildings, said Craig A. Reiner, director of New Jersey's Office of Emergency Telecommunications Services.</p>
        <p>Callers using phones from AT &amp; T, Cingular and T-Mobile can be located by a process known as triangulation. But that system also has its shortcomings. Mrs. Pincus was using a Cingular phone when she called for help last month, but Suffolk's system is only able to detect the location of callers using AT &amp; T phones within the county.</p>
        <p>''We only knew what cell tower it came from,'' said the 911 coordinator in Suffolk, Matthew F. Jones. ''Triangulation only works off cell towers located in Suffolk County. A call coming from Connecticut just won't work.''</p>
