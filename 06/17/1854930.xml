        <p>Sylvia Kaplan, right, 63, and her husband Ken, 66, New Jersey retirees from Green Cove Springs, Fla.: ''My husband had been dreaming of getting an RV for the last 20 some years, and I'd kind of been a workaholic, so when he said he really wanted to do this, I finally gave in a couple of years ago. I never thought I would like it, but I love it. It's a wonderful way to travel and see places. This was our first really big trip. We'd never been to California, or to a place in the United States where they had hot springs and that kind of climate, so we were really excited. We also love birding, and on this trip we added more birds to our list than we ever dreamed we would see. We've just had the chance now to experience so many different environments, it's been a real eye-opener.''</p>
