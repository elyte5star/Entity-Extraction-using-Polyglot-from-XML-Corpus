        <p>Weil mentions the Finnish system of delaying academic learning until children are 7. We spent the year of my husband's sabbatical (1998-99) in Turku, Finland, where our 6-year-old daughter, who would have entered first grade here, was eligible only for a half-day kindergarten program. At first I was upset, but it proved to be a fabulous year for her, with almost no academic expectations but with a rich curriculum for creative growth as well as vigorous outdoor exercise every day. The teachers I spoke to thought it was actually damaging to children to teach reading and math before age 7 and that the early years were the appropriate time to stress the social and emotional growth also necessary for later school success.</p>
