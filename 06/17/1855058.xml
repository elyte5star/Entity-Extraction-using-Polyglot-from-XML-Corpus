        <p>With an agreement to stop harassing day laborers and the opening of a privately run day labor hiring site in a village church, Mamaroneck took some long-overdue steps last week toward developing a responsible and humane approach to its influx of immigrant workers.</p>
        <p>They were important steps, and strikingly positive ones, though they were not necessarily conclusive or monumental. Just as immigration doomsayers must realize that one hiring site will not bury the village in a wave of illegal workers, those who were encouraged by last week's developments must not expect that community tensions will now vanish or that an informal labor market will instantly become tidy and suburban-perfect.</p>
        <p>The difficult work, in other words, is just beginning.</p>
        <p>But there is still good reason for relief and praise. Much credit goes to the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit that forced stiff-necked officials to abandon their campaign of using the police to hound day laborers out of the village. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the suit on behalf of six Mamaroneck laborers and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. Their victory means that the village will end up paying more than $1.2 million in legal fees and other costs -- a high price for litigation that should have been avoided. The village trustees who approved last week's agreement to pay the plaintiffs' lawyers and pull back the police were wise not to gamble more taxpayer money on an appeal.</p>
        <p>The village's failed crackdown strategy has been replaced by something positive and creative. Villagers who grew weary of all the shouting and litigation should gratefully credit the doggedness of the Hispanic Resource Center, a local nonprofit organization, and the generosity of Strait Gate Baptist Church, whose predominantly black congregation has agreed to let the laborers use their sanctuary and parking lot as the hiring site.</p>
        <p>''It's an unusual gesture, and it's a beautiful one,'' Pablo Alvarado of the laborers' network told Fernanda Santos of The Times. There are not many examples of black churches reaching out to Latino laborers in this way, and Strait Gate Baptist, led by Bishop Wayne L. Powell, has set an example that other churches and communities should follow.</p>
        <p>The hiring site will not resolve the inconsistencies of a failed federal immigration system. It will not erase the anger and frustration of citizens who see illegal immigration as a fundamental breach of American security and values -- like the two hard-liners in baseball caps who went up from Manhattan last week and tried, more poignantly than menacingly, to disrupt the ceremonial opening at the church. Those are big problems that Congress, in all its tortured impotence, has not yet seen fit to act upon.</p>
        <p>All that the Mamaroneck hiring site will do is help, in a small way, to enhance orderliness in the village, to protect vulnerable workers from robbery and other abuses and to begin integrating them into the community. If organizers get the site running smoothly, its neighbors and others in the village may soon come to recognize that the men (and some women) who use it are not ''locusts,'' as one former village trustee put it, or problems to be managed, or hard-luck cases to be patronizingly ministered to. They are simply grown-ups who are trying to make a living, something that the rest of Mamaroneck -- no longer burdened by hostility, resentment and a hard-nosed, anti-laborer crusade -- can get back to thinking about, too.</p>
