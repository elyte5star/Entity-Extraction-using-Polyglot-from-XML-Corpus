        <p>Haydn: Piano Sonatas (10)  Marc-André Hamelin, pianist. Hyperion CDA67554; two CD's.</p>
        <p>YOU never know quite what to expect from Marc-André Hamelin. Last encountered in a treasurable recording of Albéniz's ''Iberia'' from Hyperion, Mr. Hamelin has based a highly productive career mostly on big Romantic and 20th-century works, often little known if at all.</p>
        <p>Now he veers toward the Classical and the familiar, and the element of surprise permeates the performances themselves. True, much of the unpredictability is written into the music. Haydn reveled in suspense, misdirection and jokes large and small, nowhere more so than in the C major Sonata (Hob. XVI:50). The hop, step and a jump of an opening theme is itself a little joke, beautifully spun out here. Mr. Hamelin's crisp touch keeps it constantly lively, though he relishes the two opportunities to douse the theme in a wash of pedal. The finale is just as playful, with its frequent hesitations and harmonic twists, and again Mr. Hamelin's humor is irresistible.</p>
        <p>His fabulous technical aplomb has always been evident in music that demands it far more than Haydn ever does, but he finds a few places to let loose here. In the Presto of the G major Sonata (Hob. XVI:40), he starts at what seems an almost impossible clip, evoking a music box run amok. Not only does the tempo turn out to be possible, but in the reprises Mr. Hamelin adds whole handfuls of ornamentation that might have made Haydn himself catch his breath and chuckle. It all lends a giddy, almost levitating quality to this delightful little romp.</p>
        <p>But all this attention to Mr. Hamelin's technical command should not be taken to imply any deficiency in more songful or lyrical moments. As so often, he commands attention at least as much for his unfailing lyrical bent and for the clarity and shapeliness of his phrasing in subdued passages as he does for his boffo moments.</p>
