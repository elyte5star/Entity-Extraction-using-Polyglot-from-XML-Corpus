        <p>As someone who grew up in the Highbridge section of the Bronx in the 1940s and '50s, I was very much touched by ''A Much-Loved Library, Locked for Two Years'' (June 3). For my friends and I who attended P.S. 11 or Sacred Heart, the local library was a destination of cool comfort on summer days when the streets were too hot to play in. During the school year the children's library, then on the 168th Street side, was where we went to research our earliest school assignments or borrow the books we needed for book reports.</p>

        <p>As someone who grew up in the Highbridge section of the Bronx in the 1940s and '50s, I was very much touched by ''A Much-Loved Library, Locked for Two Years'' (June 3). For my friends and I who attended P.S. 11 or Sacred Heart, the local library was a destination of cool comfort on summer days when the streets were too hot to play in. During the school year the children's library, then on the 168th Street side, was where we went to research our earliest school assignments or borrow the books we needed for book reports.</p>
        <p>As we matured, we looked forward to the day when we reached the age of admission to the adult section, the entrance to which was on Woodycrest Avenue. It was here that I eagerly pursued my interest in snakes and other reptiles by borrowing every Raymond Ditmars book I could lay my hands on. How disappointed I was when I found that the 598.1 section was relatively limited, and so I had to expand my interests. But then vast vistas opened up.</p>
        <p>I am saddened that those people mentioned your article will lose their library, though only for two years. For a child coming of age those two years may seem an eternity.</p>
