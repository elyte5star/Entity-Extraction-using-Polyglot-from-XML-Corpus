        <p>HIS beefy fist still grabs yours hard in a handshake, like it did during his nearly three decades in Albany, and he still sports monogrammed cuffs on the sleeves of his starched business shirts.</p>
        <p>But Nicholas A. Spano, a veteran Westchester Republican who was the only incumbent state legislator to lose in November's election, is selling commercial real estate in White Plains these days, instead of shepherding bills through the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Spano appears happy in his new job, his back stiffens when the word ''retirement'' is used.</p>
        <p>''What retirement?'' he responded indignantly during a recent interview. ''Well, I guess I have to admit that transitioning to the private sector after going 100 miles an hour in Albany for 28 years has been an adjustment. Up until recently, I lived my life according to the legislative calendar.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano, 54, represented the 35th District, which includes Yonkers, Greenburgh and Mount Pleasant, in the State Senate from 1986 to last year, and in the State Assembly from 1979 to 1985. For most of those 28 years, he was a popular and powerful legislator who earned a reputation for doling out state money, often in the form of ''member items,'' to a wide variety of county constituents he deemed worthy.</p>
        <p>His only real re-election scare came in 2004, when he beat Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat, by only 18 votes. Their fiercely contested rematch was not as close, with Ms. Stewart-Cousins winning in November by nearly 1,800 votes.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Spano often drew bipartisan support from voters, he attributed his defeat, in part, to a shift in the county's demographics in recent years, with ''more hard-core Democrats from New York City moving in,'' he said. (There are 217,091 registered Democrats in the county, compared with 137,206 Republicans.)</p>
        <p>Faced with myriad opportunities after his defeat, Mr. Spano chose to become a licensed salesman for Prudential Rand, a residential and commercial real estate agency based in White Plains, with offices throughout Westchester and surrounding counties. In his new job, he still relies on his charm and a wide network of contacts to get things done.</p>
        <p>''His political skills are very transferable to real estate,'' said Gregory S. Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano's career switch has come at an opportune time. Office vacancy rates are at their lowest in more than a decade, many commercial properties are at a premium and conversions of some manufacturing sites, like the former Phelps Dodge plant in Yonkers, are under way. Mr. Spano said his experience navigating the state bureaucracy can help potential clients, especially when it comes to remediation of contaminated properties and environmental review processes.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, it's been a seamless transition to this job,'' he said. ''Only before, I was working on the government side of things, and now I'm on the entrepreneurial end.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano still attends a seemingly endless round of dinner parties and benefits -- for firefighters at the Polish Center in Yonkers, for the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Westchester at the Fountainhead in New Rochelle, for an annual business week at Yonkers Raceway.</p>
        <p>His days as a legislator are never far behind. The Cerebral Palsy group honored him for the help he offered from Albany in guiding them through red tape so they could open a residence for people with developmental disabilities, and at the raceway, his supporters praised the major role he played in helping the track's owners receive approval for installing video lottery terminals.</p>
        <p>At home on a weekend last month, Mr. Spano said he was happy to be weeding his own garden on Colonial Parkway in Yonkers -- he showed off a blister on his thumb -- instead of putting in a political appearance at a softball game, like he used to on Saturday afternoons for local boys' and girls' clubs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano grew up in Yonkers, the oldest of 16 children -- all of whom still live in Westchester, 14 of them in Yonkers, 9 on one block. ''It's an election district all on its own,'' he said. His parents, Josephine and Leonard N. Spano -- his father is a former county clerk -- live around the block. He said his wife, Linda; his son, Lenny, 26; and his daughter, Christina, 29, are happy to have him close by again.</p>
        <p>But Albany has not entirely receded from Mr. Spano's view. In addition to working as a real estate broker, he runs Empire Strategic Planning, his own consulting and lobbying business in Hawthorne. ''The old contacts come in handy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They also keep him in the political loop. As he attends to the present, Mr. Spano freely admits to keeping an eye on the future and a possible return to politics.</p>
        <p>''I loved every minute of being in Albany,'' he said, ''and given a chance, I would do it again in a heartbeat.''</p>
