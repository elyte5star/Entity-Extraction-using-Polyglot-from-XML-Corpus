        <p>HIS old report cards read Shaffer Chimere Smith, but to the rest of us he's known by two syllables: Ne-Yo. Ne-Yo, a 24-year-old Grammy-nominated R&amp;B singer-songwriter, was back home in Atlanta after a trip to Japan to publicize his sophomore album, ''Because of You'' (Def Jam). He was in town temporarily to celebrate the opening of his recording studio -- with kitchens! -- and to announce a talent contest. (The winner scored a record deal with Ne-Yo's label, Compound Entertainment.) Seemingly the victim of a jampacked schedule, he was getting dressed while on the phone with Winter Miller. A thoughtful sentence about melody was punctuated with a request for socks. Nearing the end of his list and finally dressed, though still shirtless, he spoke from the car on the way to greet the press and fans at the new studio. The next day he was off again for his national tour.</p>
        <p>Robin Thicke</p>
        <p>He's been underrated. Not too many people remember his first album, ''A Beautiful World.'' It was a classic. Some critics called it schizophrenic, but I call it diverse. It had a lot of different vibes to it. That album was him showing his love for music -- not a particular kind of music, all music -- and the world wasn't ready for it. His second album, ''The Evolution of Robin Thicke'' (Interscope), leans more toward R&amp;B, but it's got this rare feel to it. A lot of today's R&amp;B is hip-hop-based, but the lion's portion of this album is more Marvin Gaye. It's an older sound, more traditional R&amp;B. Robin Thicke is a musical genius, and all the recognition he's getting has been a long time coming.</p>
        <p>The Feeling</p>
        <p>The song ''Sewn'' from ''Twelve Stops and Home'' (Island) is very melodic, very soulful. The melody reminds me of R&amp;B, even though they're definitely not R&amp;B. I have no idea what they're talking about (even though they're speaking English). Art only has to make sense in the eyes of the artist. It's not the kind of music that you get from most British rock bands. I've only had the chance to listen to this one song, but if their album is anything like it, they'll become a favorite of mine.</p>
        <p>Regina Spektor</p>
        <p>What struck me first about her was the song ''Fidelity,'' from ''Begin to Hope'' (Sire). The melody and the hook are what drew me in, and I picked up her album. I love her lyrical content. Any woman that can write, ''Summer in the city means cleavage cleavage cleavage'' is O.K. in my book. She almost sings without singing. You can tell she's not trying hard to sing really really good, she just does. Sometimes it just sounds like she's talking in melody. It gives a lighthearted take to her songs, and that makes me happy. She seems like she doesn't take herself too seriously. That's certainly a plus in a world where everyone else takes themselves way too seriously.</p>
        <p>Ciara</p>
        <p>I listen Ciara when I want to dance. If you're a girl, you listen to ''Like a Boy'' from ''The Evolution'' (LaFace) to feel empowered. Her music makes women feel sexy and makes guys want sex. You can't go wrong with either one. Ciara's not the strongest singer, but that doesn't take away from the validity of her music. Her melodies and cadences carry her voice; you forget she doesn't have a powerhouse voice like Mary J. Blige or Keyshia Cole. Plus, she started a whole new genre of R&amp;B, the ''crunk &amp; B'' sound with Lil Jon. I dig it. I think it's exciting somebody started something different.</p>
        <p>R. Kelly</p>
        <p>I like ''I'm a Flirt'' from ''Double Up'' (Jive) because he's obviously not taking things seriously. He's being honest about himself. It's not a serious song to get upset about. When you listen to it, you picture yourself being the flirter as opposed to the guy whose girlfriend was flirted with. Girls flirt as much as guys do -- or more -- so I can see a girl listening to it and feeling it. Of the hip-hop-R&amp;B genre nobody does it better than R. Kelly. There are three or four guys hot right now doing the sing-rap thing, and you get tired of hearing it, but there's something different and special about R. Kelly. Perhaps because he was one of the first to make it popular. Unlike a lot of the guys that do it now, his melodies don't become monotone for trying to get the point across.</p>
        <p>Linkin Park</p>
        <p>It takes talent to yell at the top of your lungs like Chester Bennington. He does that raspy thing. It's amazing he does that night after night on tour and doesn't lose his voice. On ''Minutes to Midnight'' (Warner Brothers) they mix hip-hop with rock without sacrificing the integrity of either. The rock sounds like rock, and the hip-hop sounds like hip-hop. It's a guy rapping over an electric guitar, and it's beautiful. A bunch of groups have tried the rock-hip-hop thing, and they don't sound natural. It doesn't sound like Linkin Park sat around and said, ''Hey let's be a rock group with a rapper.'' Their music doesn't sound contrived. They tend to tackle serious issues. Their lyrics make you think. There's nothing I hate more than a stupid song, or a song that makes you stupider.</p>
