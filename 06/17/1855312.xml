        <p>EVERY FRIDAY. By Dan Yaccarino. Henry Holt. $16.95. (Ages 3 to 7) ''Friday is my favorite day,'' a small boy tells us, because every Friday he and his dad go for breakfast together at the local diner. In cheerful gouache illustrations, they wave to passersby, watch shops open and buildings going up; ''everyone is rushing, but we're taking our time.'' A note from the author tells us the book is based on his weekly ritual with his own son. It is also a valentine to good dads and neighborhood diners, and a reminder on Father's Day that the ''little traditions'' are sometimes the best ones.</p>
        <p>MY CAT COPIES ME. By Yoon-duck Kwon. Kane/</p>
        <p>Miller. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) Kwon's simple text and pared-down illustrations (influenced by traditional Korean art) evoke the first love of having a pet of one's own. ''Smelling the flowers, or watching bugs, she always copies me,'' says a little girl, who thinks of her cat as her best friend. Gradually we notice that there are no other friends around, or family members; when mother works late, ''I hide under my blanket.'' Then the story takes an unexpected turn. ''I will copy my cat!'' the girl announces. The cat -- larger than life-size, with a martial-arts-like stance -- becomes a fantasy partner as the girl decides, ''Like my cat, I'll stretch my body. (I'll stretch my mind, too.) I won't be scared of anything!''</p>
        <p>AT THE FIREFLY GATE. By Linda Newbery. David Fickling/Random House. $15.99. (Ages 10 and up) When Henry finds himself moving with his parents to a village in Suffolk, England, far from his best friend Nabil or anything else he cares about, he is soon caught up in a mystery seemingly invisible to everyone but him. Somehow his mind is invaded by the memories of a World War II navigator who never returned after an ill-fated bombing run; is that the shadowy figure who waits in the dark at the garden gate? Newbery skillfully keeps the tension high, and readers will be eager to know the outcome.</p>
        <p>THE DAY MY MOTHER LEFT. By James Prosek. Simon &amp; Schuster. $15.99. (Ages 12 and up) Prosek, who wrote his well-received ''Trout: An Illustrated History'' when he was still a teenager, shows where some of his youthful determination came from. His own mother left when he was a boy, and like 9-year-old Jeremy in this semiautobiographical novel, he turned to nature and drawing for salvation. Although the mother's motivation never becomes entirely clear, the author unforgettably captures the way ''she took almost nothing with her, yet she took everything'' -- except Jeremy's talent and his will to survive.</p>
        <p>DAFFODIL, CROCODILE. By Emily Jenkins. Pictures by Tomek Bogacki. Frances Foster Books/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $16. (Ages 4 to 8) A girl who is angry about being pigeonholed as a ''nice little girl'' (along with her sisters, Violet and Rose) puts on a green papier-mÃché crocodile head for a day, with big teeth: '' 'Where's my pretty little, clean little flower?' Mommy asks. 'I ate her,' said the crocodile.'' The point isn't subtle, but Daffodil's satisfying escape from pretty perfection will reassure girls that breaking the mold and getting their knees dirty is sometimes a very good idea, even if some people think they are ''being weird.''</p>
