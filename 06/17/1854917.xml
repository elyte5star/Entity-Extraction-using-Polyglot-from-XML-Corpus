      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The French know a thing or two about symmetry. In the late 19th century, the picturesque banks of the Seine west of Paris were a favorite subject of the Impressionists; Renoir painted his famous ''Luncheon of the Boating Party'' on the balcony of the Maison Fournaise, on an island (now called L'Ãle des Impressionnistes) at Chatou. Today, floating just next door to the Maison Fournaise (restored as a restaurant), there is an artistic enterprise that is as modern now as the Impressionists were then. The Centre National de l'Estampe et de l'Art Imprimé, or Cneai -- a contemporary art center devoted to prints, multiples and artist publications -- commissioned the Paris-based designers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, who are brothers, to design a dwelling for its artist-in-residence program. But instead of a house, Cneai asked for a houseboat -- a reference to the bateaux-lavoirs, or laundry boats, that dotted the river until the early 20th century. The new structure, however, needed a contemporary form.</p>

        <p>The French know a thing or two about symmetry. In the late 19th century, the picturesque banks of the Seine west of Paris were a favorite subject of the Impressionists; Renoir painted his famous ''Luncheon of the Boating Party'' on the balcony of the Maison Fournaise, on an island (now called L'Ãle des Impressionnistes) at Chatou. Today, floating just next door to the Maison Fournaise (restored as a restaurant), there is an artistic enterprise that is as modern now as the Impressionists were then. The Centre National de l'Estampe et de l'Art Imprimé, or Cneai -- a contemporary art center devoted to prints, multiples and artist publications -- commissioned the Paris-based designers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, who are brothers, to design a dwelling for its artist-in-residence program. But instead of a house, Cneai asked for a houseboat -- a reference to the bateaux-lavoirs, or laundry boats, that dotted the river until the early 20th century. The new structure, however, needed a contemporary form.</p>
        <p>Collaborating with Denis Daversin, an architect, and Jean-Marie Finot, a renowned naval architect, the Bouroullecs designed the Maison Flottante, or Floating House, which was completed late last year in Le Havre and towed more than 100 miles upriver to Chatou. The vessel is just over 75 feet long and 16 feet wide, with just under 1,000 square feet of living space and a spacious deck. Its sleek, aluminum-skinned structure is wrapped with a wooden trellis that will one day be covered with flowering vines. While there are no windows on the bank side (for privacy), the water side has generous windows, the bottom edges of which are nearly at the level of the water, making you feel as if you are literally floating on its surface, and allowing dappled reflections of light to wash across the interior walls, which are made of fragrant red cedar. In an atmosphere like this, you'd be Renoir, too.</p>
