      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I read Elizabeth Weil's article with interest (June 3). As the mother of a first grader who is a year younger than many of his classmates, I have struggled with issues of readiness, maturity and size. However, as a high-school teacher, I have had experience with the consequences of the decision to begin kids later. Increasingly, 12th-grade classrooms are filled with students at the tail end of their teenage years. I'm curious why articles that address this issue rarely look at it from the perspective of high-school students. At some point, do the benefits that accrue from delayed entry to kindergarten turn into deficits, as students find themselves graduating from high school at 19 and college at 23?</p>
