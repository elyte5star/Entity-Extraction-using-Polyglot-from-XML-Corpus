        <p>West Village Studio  $499,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 111 West 11th Street (between Sixth and Seventh Avenues), #2FE</p>
        <p>A studio with a sleeping alcove and a washer and dryer in a walk-up building. Nancy Haber, Bellmarc Realty (212) 627-3000, ext. 215; www.bellmarc.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $535 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Charming prewar touches include an original fireplace and moldings. The renovated bathroom and kitchen have sleek finishes.</p>
        <p>CONS: There is no bathtub. Built-in storage in the sleeping alcove can't help but be partly blocked by the bed.</p>
        <p>Park Slope Co-op  $375,000</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: 19 Fiske Place (near Garfield Place), # D1</p>
        <p>A one-bedroom, one-bath fourth-floor co-op in a 1920s walk-up with common storage and laundry. Anita Culp, Corcoran Group (718) 210-4002; www.corcoran.com.</p>
        <p>Open house Sunday, 2 to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $552 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: On a charming blocklong street two blocks from Prospect Park, this unit has appealing prewar touches.</p>
        <p>CONS: The living room looks out on a brick wall.</p>
        <p>1929 Tudor  $735,000</p>
        <p>WESTCHESTER: 50 Sunnyside Avenue, Tarrytown</p>
        <p>A three-bedroom, two-bath, three-story brick Tudor with casement widows and architectural details from the 1920s. It sits on a 0.18-acre terraced lot. Robin Birrittella, Legends Realty Group (914) 332-1010; www.legendsrealtygroup.net</p>
        <p>TAXES: $14,680 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: There are hardwood floors throughout, as well as a stone fireplace in the living room, granite counters and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, and meticulous landscaping. The house is unconventional and eclectic, with charming nooks and crannies.</p>
        <p>CONS: Because both the house and its gardens have many steps and levels (some steep), this house is not child-friendly.</p>
        <p>1825 Colonial  $449,000</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY: 305 West Mendham Road, Mendham</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath home on almost an acre of wooded property in a neighborhood of historic homes and hiking trails. A full restoration took place in the 1990s, and the kitchen was updated in 2004. The house has original pine floors and stairs, four fireplaces and woodstoves, a folk art mural of local history and a two-car garage with a finished loft. Janet Ellis, Coldwell Banker (973) 543-2552, ext. 231; www.coldwellbanker.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $6,651 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: The house exudes the distinctive charm of a well-cared-for historic property.</p>
        <p>CONS: There is a fairly busy street nearby. The loft space has no bathroom.</p>
        <p>Gramercy Park Co-op  $2,100,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 44 Gramercy Park North (at Gramercy Park East), #4C</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath co-op in a prewar doorman building. Wendy Maitland, Brown Harris Stevens (212) 317-3660; www.brownharrisstevens.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,640 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: The living room and master bedroom have lovely views of Gramercy Park, a private garden to which the building has several keys. The eat-in kitchen is cleverly laid out with unusual details like windowed drawers to hold pasta and a large refrigerator with a windowed door. Casement windows and antique bedroom doors give this apartment added character.</p>
        <p>CONS: The second bedroom is a bit dark, as its window faces a wall.</p>
