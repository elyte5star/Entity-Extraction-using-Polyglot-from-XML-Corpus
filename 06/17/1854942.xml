        <p>A message to those who have applied for -- and are eagerly awaiting -- passports: relax. The Departments of State and Homeland Security announced on June 8 that through Sept. 30, United States citizens traveling to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda may enter and depart the United States by air as long as they have a government-issued photo identification and proof that they have applied for a passport. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which has required passports for all air travel outside of United States territories since Jan. 23, has created a record demand for passports, meaning longer processing and turnaround times. Details are at www.travel.state.gov.  Want more ''Pirates of the Caribbean''? Hotels on Dominica, which provided some locations for the movies starring Johnny Depp (below), have created packages for pirate-crazy travelers. A seven-night experience offered by Calibishie Lodges (www.calibishie-lodges.com) includes visits to eight spots used in the movies; it is available for $599 a person, double occupancy, if reserved by June 30. A seven-day package offered by the Tamarind Tree Hotel and Restaurant (www.tamarindtreedominica.com) includes tours led by the driver for Gore Verbinski, the movie's director, starting at $1,615 a person, double, with all meals. Other pirate-themed packages are being offered by the Anchorage Hotel (www.anchoragehotel.dm), the Hummingbird Inn (www.find-us.net/hummingbird) -- ask at these two when you reserve -- and the Fort Young Hotel (www.fortyounghotel.com).  American Airlines (www.aa.com) recently announced that all AAdvantage members must redeem or accrue miles at least once every 18 months to keep their accounts active. Starting Dec. 15, mileage accounts that have not changed in the previous year and a half will expire.</p>
