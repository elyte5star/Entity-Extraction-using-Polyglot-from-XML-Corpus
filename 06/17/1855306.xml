        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I just read ''For the Children, a Mother Revisits Her Sorrow,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, June 10). Our stories are so similar it took my breath away. Except for the fact that my son Peter never made it to college, he was the same kind of boy.</p>
        <p>It has been many years now, 22 to be exact, and yes, we visit his grave, and each time we do it seems like only a short time ago that he died.</p>
        <p>My heart goes out to Ms. Katz. I know, I know.</p>
