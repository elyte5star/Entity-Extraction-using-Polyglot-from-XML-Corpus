        <p>A five-week surge in bond yields has concerned stock investors, leading to big losses the previous week. And last week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 5.16 percent, up from 5.1 percent a week earlier -- and nearly half a percentage point higher than it had been at the beginning of the year. But on Friday, a relatively moderate report on inflation -- the core Consumer Price Index rose by 2.2 percent on an annual basis in May -- evidently calmed some concerns.</p>
        <p>General Motors gained 11.8 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials, on a report that the company is seeking concessions on its health care costs from the United Automobile Workers union. Intel, which said it would cut the price of some of its chips, gained 11 percent for the week</p>
        <p>For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 215.09 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 13,639.48. The S.&amp; P. 500 climbed 25.24 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 1,532.91. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 53.17 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 2,626.71.</p>
