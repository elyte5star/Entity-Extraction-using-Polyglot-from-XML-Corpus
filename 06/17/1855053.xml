        <p>The comfort food that Church's Kitchen serves is sustenance not only for the stomach, but also for the soul. The golden-fried chicken, juicy with a crispy crust, is just one of the many homey choices on the menu at this family-run takeout shop in the Vauxhall area of Union.</p>
        <p>For a satisfying lunch, order a three-piece chicken meal (choice of thigh, leg, wing or breast), which comes with two side dishes and a roll ($5.81 to $7.99). The mustard potato salad and creamy coleslaw are good accompaniments; other possibilities include French fries and mashed potatoes with gravy. If you're going on a picnic, pick up a 20-piece pan of chicken ($26.81) and perhaps some corn on the cob ($1.50 an ear).</p>

        <p>For a satisfying lunch, order a three-piece chicken meal (choice of thigh, leg, wing or breast), which comes with two side dishes and a roll ($5.81 to $7.99). The mustard potato salad and creamy coleslaw are good accompaniments; other possibilities include French fries and mashed potatoes with gravy. If you're going on a picnic, pick up a 20-piece pan of chicken ($26.81) and perhaps some corn on the cob ($1.50 an ear).</p>
        <p>You can take home a rack of pork or beef ribs ($15.95 for pork, $16.95 for beef); classic accompaniments include macaroni and cheese and baked beans (starting at $2.50 for eight ounces) and cornbread (50 cents a slice). A fried catfish dinner with two sides is $14.99.</p>
        <p>As for desserts, the cobbler features tender peaches and hints of nutmeg, and coconut custard pie is another favorite. Both are $2.99 a slice.</p>
        <p>The owners are a husband-and-wife team, Judy and Leroy Church, who started this storefront operation 12 years ago. They make everything from scratch and ''cook all day,'' according to Mrs. Church. They guard their culinary secrets but say they do all their frying with vegetable oil and don't use milk batter with the chicken.</p>
        <p>Meals are cooked to order, so expect to wait about 15 minutes for your food, unless you call ahead. But the wait can be a pleasant one -- Church's is the kind of place that lends itself to easy conversation. The food is takeout only; Church's has no seating.</p>
        <p>Church's Kitchen, 2117 Springfield Avenue, Vauxhall; (908) 810-1686. Open Monday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
