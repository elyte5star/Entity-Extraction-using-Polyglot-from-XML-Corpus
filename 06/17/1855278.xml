        <p>A state ethics panel on Saturday disbarred Michael B. Nifong, the Durham district attorney who pursued a false accusation of sexual assault against three Duke University lacrosse players, shortly after Mr. Nifong said through his lawyer that he thought disbarment was appropriate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong, who had surprised his lawyers Friday by announcing plans to resign, offered to have his license revoked and waive the right to appeal after the panel ruled Saturday that he had been dishonest or deceitful toward a judge and defense lawyers over DNA results.</p>
        <p>David B. Freedman, one of Mr. Nifong's lawyers, said in an interview, ''He wants this over. He wanted the process to play out and to receive a fair hearing, and he believes he has received a fair hearing and accepts the findings of the commission.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman said Mr. Nifong had been ''devastated'' by the testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong declined comment, but his wife, Cy Gurney, said, ''It's a day of resolution -- for us and hopefully for the court system.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Nifong offered to be disbarred, the ethics panel said it still had to decide on a penalty, and 40 minutes later it issued a scathing opinion.</p>
        <p>''There is no discipline short of disbarment that would be appropriate in this case,'' said F. Lane Williamson, a Charlotte lawyer who led the panel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williamson blamed Mr. Nifong's political ambitions in March 2006 for a publicity blitz that led to the ''fiasco'' in which innocent young men were charged and the legal system suffered disrepute. Mr. Nifong denied any political motives.</p>
        <p>''We had a prosecutor who was faced with a very unusual situation in which the confluence of his self-interest collided with a very volatile mix of race, sex and class,'' Mr. Williamson said of the media spectacle that accompanied the case in which a black woman who worked as a stripper accused three white lacrosse players.</p>
        <p>The panel ruled that Mr. Nifong had misled a judge and defense lawyers about findings from a private laboratory that showed DNA from four unidentified men on the body and clothes of the stripper. No DNA from any lacrosse players was found.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong has insisted he did not lie about the DNA evidence, but he has admitted that his public statements stirred outrage and were unethical.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong's lawyers said that no date had been set for the resignation but that it would be prompt. The disbarment takes effect in 30 days.</p>
        <p>Kevin J. Finnerty, father of one of the lacrosse players, said, ''I think that was justice. I think it was appropriate. I think it was leading there anyway, and the chairman said so. It was a nice gesture on his part, and gesture accepted. Justice served.''</p>
        <p>Joseph B. Cheshire, a defense lawyer for another player, said, ''To me, it's kind of like the guy who's going to be executed Wednesday and he figures out on Tuesday night how to tear up his bed sheet and hang himself so he can be in control of his own destiny.'' Mr. Cheshire said he was pleased Mr. Nifong gave up appeal rights.</p>
        <p>David C. Evans, the father of another player, said: ''My reaction is we take no pleasure in this and that people should realize that the North Carolina criminal justice system is strong. We've got the North Carolina Bar Association presenting this case and the North Carolina attorney general making a fair and independent investigation.''</p>
        <p>Earlier Saturday, in closing arguments on the ethics case, Dudley Witt, a lawyer for Mr. Nifong, argued that Mr. Nifong was an ''old-school prosecutor'' who had never dealt with the media and never had a DNA report other than from the state laboratory. While admitting many mistakes, including inattention to the unknown DNA matches, Mr. Witt said, ''He's a very truthful guy.''</p>
        <p>Doug Brock, a lawyer for the North Carolina State Bar, the state agency bringing the case, said, ''From his very first involvement in this case, Mr. Nifong weaved a web of deception, which continued up to this hearing.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 22, 2007, Friday  An article on Sunday about the disbarment of Michael B. Nifong, the district attorney in Durham County, N.C., misstated the surname of a North Carolina State Bar lawyer who made closing arguments in the ethics trial of Mr. Nifong. He is Doug Brocker, not Doug Brock.</p>
