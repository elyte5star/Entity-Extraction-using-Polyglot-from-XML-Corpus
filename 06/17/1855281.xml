        <p>Doctors, pharmacists, and emergency room personnel may one day have instant access to the medical records of patients in New Jersey.

        <p>''We will never achieve anything close to universal access to health insurance unless we save the costs that can be saved in health care by reducing all the redundant studies that we do and reduce the costs of performing transactions in health care,'' said Dr. Herb Conaway, a Democratic assemblyman from Burlington who was one of the primary sponsors of the bill.

        <p>Doctors, pharmacists, and emergency room personnel may one day have instant access to the medical records of patients in New Jersey. The State Assembly passed a measure on Monday that would create an electronic database and infrastructure to share patient information, which supporters say would save more than $700 million by eliminating unnecessary paperwork, tests and administrative costs.</p>
        <p>''We will never achieve anything close to universal access to health insurance unless we save the costs that can be saved in health care by reducing all the redundant studies that we do and reduce the costs of performing transactions in health care,'' said Dr. Herb Conaway, a Democratic assemblyman from Burlington who was one of the primary sponsors of the bill. Mr. Conaway, a practicing physician, said that he believes an electronic system is more efficient for both patients and doctors.</p>
        <p>The bill would also create a 15-member commission to develop the system and tackle questions regarding security and privacy, he said.</p>
        <p>At this point, the bill does not address how the system would be paid for and who would cover the costs of scanning paper versions of past medical records for patients. The State Board of Nursing, which is part of the Division of Consumer Affairs, declined to support the measure because the bill did not include estimated costs. A spokesman for the Division of Consumer Affairs said that no one from the board was available for comment.</p>
        <p>State Senator Joseph F. Vitale, a Democrat from Woodbridge, is sponsoring a similar version of the bill in the Senate. ''This system will help minimize medical errors and mistakes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vitale, the chairman of the Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee, said he intends to introduce the legislation in the next committee hearing and expects it to reach a vote in the Senate this year.</p>
