        <p>This is the time of year that music grows feet. From fall to spring the Metropolitan Opera sits at Lincoln Center and waits for its audience to come to it. This week, it is coming to a park near you. THE METROPOLITAN OPERA IN THE PARKS season will bring along a repertory that is beloved with a capital B, and the admission is free.</p>
        <p>A mobile stage and lots of loudspeakers do not make for a pristine listening experience, and the shows may be something like picnics and conversation, with opera as a kind of Muzak in the background. Also, don't look for much in the way of staging, costumes and production values.</p>
        <p>The rewards, on the other hand, are many. The most valuable is the crowd itself: a wondrous mix of the operatically inclined, the plain curious and people who just want a night under the stars and don't mind if music goes along with it.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday Gounod's ''Faust'' is performed at Prospect Park in Brooklyn. On Wednesday the Met makes its way to Cunningham Park in Queens, with ''La Bohème'' by Puccini on the program. On Friday it's ''Faust'' again at Brookdale Park in Bloomfield and Montclair, N.J. On Saturday the Met stays in New Jersey for a repeat of ''La Bohème,'' this time at Buccleuch Park in New Brunswick.</p>
        <p>The Met's parks series often uses the opportunity to try out singers who are either new to or not established in this country. Discoveries and surprises (good or bad) are part of the fun. You'll need a blanket, but tickets aren't required. All performances at 8, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free.</p>
