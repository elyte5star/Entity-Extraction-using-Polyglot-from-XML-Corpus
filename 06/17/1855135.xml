        <p>Beach cover-ups achieve a luxurious level, thanks to a line of summer dresses, tunics and pants by Taka. The bright, lavishly patterned clothes are made in super-fine woven cottons, so lightweight they can be worn as cover-ups over swimsuits, but opaque enough to be worn as street clothing. Look for beautiful hand-beaded detailing, braided camisole straps, microfringed hems and pants with elastic waists for yoga lovers or poolside lounging ($114 to $289 at Gatsbys in Great Barrington, Mass.; 413-528-9455). Made in Turkey -- the decorative embroideries represent regions of the country -- the clothes are the handiwork of village women whose cottage industry helps support their families.</p>
