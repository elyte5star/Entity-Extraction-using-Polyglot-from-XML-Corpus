        <p>THE BASICS</p>
        <p>With high-end hotels announcing new arrivals like so many coming-out parties, it's increasingly difficult to consider Prague a cheap and austere destination. The flashiest new entry there is a Mandarin Oriental, just the fourth European address for the chain. Opened in September, the hotel occupies three old buildings -- a span of Gothic, Baroque and Renaissance -- and one new wing just off a quiet cobblestone square in the Mala Strana district on the left bank of the Vltava River. Setting its plush day spa in a former Gothic monastery, the hotel replaces ascetic privation with indulgent pampering. A sense of clumsy newness (and some exposed screws) occasionally intruded during my stay in November. But by the time I revisited last month, everything had been set right. The price tag is predictably steep: doubles start at 219 euros in low season and at 389 euros in high season ($302 and $537, at $1.38 to the euro). But the overall impression is of a new level of opulence bridging Central Europe and the Far East.</p>
        <p>THE LOCATION</p>
        <p>Perfect for cultivated sightseeing, nestled between the Czech Museum of Music and the Ministry of Culture just off Maltezske Namesti, a quiet square near Charles Bridge. You couldn't find a better spot in Mala Strana without encountering more noise and bigger crowds.</p>
        <p>THE CROWD</p>
        <p>Romantic couples flying in from London for the weekend, alongside Japanese families, young Hollywood types scouting locations and, just before my visit, the Dalai Lama, in town for a conference.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS</p>
        <p>Impossible to categorize: 99 rooms in buildings from different eras, with such period details as parquet floors and frescoes in addition to brand-new features. Only a few have significant views, though all display great design, with reams of rich fabrics in contrasting textures. Many have unique designs to fit the space: one relatively inexpensive room, No. 332, comes with a sunken tub and exposed beams.</p>
        <p>THE BATHROOM</p>
        <p>Designed as if you will spend a lot of time there. Even the smallest include a flat-screen TV, heated limestone floors and black marble counters. The toiletries, from Aromatherapy Associates, include more lotions and body washes than most people could possibly use, to say nothing of soaps, shampoos, nail and skin care equipment, combs, toothbrushes and toothpaste. The cloudlike white towels were larger than my biggest comforter back home.</p>
        <p>THE AMENITIES</p>
        <p>Cosmopolitan. The TVs display 29 channels in English, French, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Russian, Czech and Slovak, and include DVD players. High-speed Ethernet connections cost 550 koruny (about $26 at 21.3 koruny to the dollar) for 24 hours. The spa is perhaps the most historic place you'll ever get an Oriental salt body scrub (1,000 koruny for 20 minutes): remnants of the convent's 13th-century foundations are visible though a clear floor.</p>
        <p>ROOM SERVICE</p>
        <p>Limited but varied: the truncated 24-hour menu includes a veggie samosa with chutney (200 koruny) as well as burgers and fries; more options, including children's plates, are available during the day. Here, service found its dancing feet: two sandwiches, two juices and a bottle of water (865 koruny, including a 15 percent service charge) took exactly 25 minutes, as promised. But because I'd left my ''do not disturb'' signal (a red silk tassel) on the door, the waiter phoned to double-check if it was O.K. to deliver. He called later to ask if he should take things away, and arrived within minutes of my ''yes.''</p>
        <p>THE BOTTOM LINE</p>
        <p>Beautiful, loaded and initially a bit awkward, like an heiress making her society debut half a year too early, on heels half an inch too high. But after nine months, she owns this town.</p>
        <p>Mandarin Oriental, Nebovidska 1, Prague; (420) 233 088 888; www.mandarinoriental.com/prague.</p>
