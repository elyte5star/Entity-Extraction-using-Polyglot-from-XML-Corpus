        <p>SPOOR--Martin, a wonderful husband, father, son, brother, friend, and doctor, died tragically on June 4, 2007 while helping others. We all miss him terribly and treasure the many memories built from his enthusiasm and love of music, travels, sports, fun, and the outdoors. Most of all we will remember his love of life, his wonderful sense of humor, and his thoughtfulness and gentleness with people. His wife, Susan, along with their three children, his parents, brother, and extended family are tremendously appreciative of the support and love from everyone. Condolences may be expressed through the family's website listed below. Visitors to the website will also find more information about Martin. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Spoor Childrens Fund accessible through the website. http://sitemaker.umich.edu/ spoorfamily.</p>
