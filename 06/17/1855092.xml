        <p>PRICES are a big attraction at Dixon Mills, an apartment complex set in historic brick factory buildings here that is being converted from rentals to condominiums. The condos run about 60 percent less than for comparable space in Manhattan, according to the Robert Martin Company, the developer doing the conversion.</p>
        <p>The apartments are distinctive, the streets are cobblestone, and there is even parking for most of the 467 units. In addition, from the top floor the views -- of Manhattan, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Statue of Liberty -- are nonpareil.</p>
        <p>The catch? ''Well, I guess it's New Jersey,'' laughed Timothy M. Jones, a partner at Robert Martin. ''It's still a wide river in some respects. A lot of people don't even think about coming to New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Given the increasing price disparity, however, more New Yorkers are said to be giving New Jersey a look. Various developers offering new condos along the Jersey ''Gold Coast'' are reporting that the number of home shoppers venturing west of the Hudson River is up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones's partner at Robert Martin, Greg Berger, said that when his company began work at Dixon Mills last year, only about 10 or 15 percent of those looking at the condominiums were considering a move from New York City. Now, nearly 30 percent are from Manhattan or other boroughs, he said. ''Given the price disparity that exists,'' Mr. Berger added, ''I think huge crowds should be beating down our doors.''</p>
        <p>Studios as well as one-, two- and three-bedroom condominiums, some with balconies and patios, have asking prices from the mid-$200,000s ranging up to the mid-$600,000s.</p>
        <p>Because the complex is horizontal rather than vertical -- there are six brick buildings, with four or five floors -- there are more than 100 penthouse units available, some priced below $300,000.</p>
        <p>''We had a guy in here from Park Slope,'' Mr. Berger said last week. ''He had been looking for months and couldn't find anything in New York -- and that was at $650 per square foot. We're in the mid-$400s per square foot here.''</p>
        <p>''This particular guy works downtown'' in Manhattan, Mr. Berger said, ''and he can catch the PATH train three blocks from here and be at work in 10 minutes, and he was, like, 'Oh! This is a no-brainer.' ''</p>
        <p>The complex at 158 Wayne Street is also bordered by Christopher Columbus Drive, Mercer Street and Brunswick Street. The Grove Street PATH station is three blocks east on Christopher Columbus.</p>
        <p>Built in 1847 on seven acres as the factory for Joseph Dixon, whose most famous invention was the yellow Dixon Ticonderoga pencil, Dixon Mills is situated between two historic brownstone neighborhoods: Hamilton Park and Van Vorst.</p>
        <p>Its Romanesque Revival-style buildings were transformed into rental apartments -- 122 of them two-story duplexes and 10 of them three-story triplexes -- more than 20 years ago. The layouts are quirky, with no two precisely the same; ceiling heights range from 9 to 12 feet. Many have private entrances.</p>
        <p>There are 222 one-bedroom units, 159 two-bedrooms, a dozen three-bedrooms and 74 studios.</p>
        <p>The buildings retain their original oversized factory windows, overhead pipes and exposed brick interior walls. One structure is to be made over into a community clubhouse with a fitness center, sports courts, locker rooms, sauna, WiFi laptop bar, screening room, kitchen and lounge. The layouts of the other five buildings will remain as they are.</p>
        <p>Robert Martin, which is based in Elmont, N.Y., is upgrading the interiors with high-end kitchens, marble baths and refinished floors.</p>
        <p>The work is being done without displacing tenants, who may choose to renew their one-year leases up to three times under New Jersey laws governing conversions, and who have the first option to buy the units in which they reside.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, the first 50 converted units were put on the market, and contracts have been signed for 60 percent of them, Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>The developer is renovating all of the buildings' interior courtyards, and each is being given a theme. One will feature tropical plants and cozy seats. Another will have an original artwork -- an etched-glass waterfall sculpture -- installed under a glass canopy roof. A third courtyard, which has a huge skylight and three levels of interior balconies, will have nostalgic streetlamps creating a ''town square'' effect. And the fourth will be done up to resemble a French town plaza, with window awnings, umbrella tables and a town clock.</p>
        <p>The sprawling exterior courtyard of the fifth residential building is being relandscaped and outfitted with community barbecue grills.</p>
        <p>When the building is entirely converted, a community association will be formed to maintain the common areas, according to Mr. Jones.</p>
        <p>Among the current offerings at Dixon Mills is a 943-square-foot duplex with one bedroom, one and a half baths, exposed brick and a small terrace. It is priced at $388,330 with a common charge of $539 a month.</p>
        <p>A three-story condo with 1,257 square feet, two bedrooms, two baths, a balcony and a rooftop deck is priced at $475,670, with a monthly fee of $719.</p>
        <p>One penthouse duplex with a large rooftop terrace that wraps around two sides of the apartment, a Juliet balcony and a straight-on unobstructed view of the Statue of Liberty was decorated and shown as a model. Priced at $600,000, the two-bedroom, two-bath unit immediately generated competing bids, and Mr. Jones said last week that he expected it to sell for about $650,000.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the average price in the first quarter of this year for a one-bedroom condo in Manhattan was more than $813,000 and for a two-bedroom condo was $1.7 million, according to a report by Prudential Douglas Elliman. For co-ops, the average was more than $570,000 for a one-bedroom and more than $1.3 million for a two-bedroom.</p>
