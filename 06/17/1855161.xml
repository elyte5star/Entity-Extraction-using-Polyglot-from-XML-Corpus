        <p>Excerpts from previously published reviews of restaurants on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn (Good Eating column) (S)</p>

        <p>Although the dining scene in Park Slope has spread around the neighborhood in the past few years, with a blossoming restaurant row on Seventh Avenue and promising newcomers on Sixth Avenue, Fifth Avenue has held firm as the center, with star players like these.</p>
        <p>AL DI LÀ ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (718) 783-4565; 248 Fifth Avenue (Carroll Street); $$; Review: 1/11/06.</p>
        <p>Anna Klinger and Emiliano Coppa, the married American-and-Italian couple who own and run Al di Là, haven't changed the menu all that much since they opened it in late 1998, but why should they? The restaurant's fans would justifiably squawk if they could no longer order a dish like the casunziei, house-made ravioli stuffed with a blend of roasted beets and ricotta, then coated with melted butter and poppy seeds.</p>

        <p>Anna Klinger and Emiliano Coppa, the married American-and-Italian couple who own and run Al di Là, haven't changed the menu all that much since they opened it in late 1998, but why should they? The restaurant's fans would justifiably squawk if they could no longer order a dish like the casunziei, house-made ravioli stuffed with a blend of roasted beets and ricotta, then coated with melted butter and poppy seeds.</p>
        <p>Like so much else at Al di Là, it's an important reminder that Italian food doesn't need to be fancied up or elaborately fussed over to rise to a high level.</p>
        <p>BLUE RIBBON SUSHI * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 840-0408; 278 Fifth Avenue (First Street); $$$; Review: 4/2/03.</p>
        <p>This is Park Slope's version of SoHo's Blue Ribbon Sushi. The dining room, with its beamed ceilings and dark wooden window slats, is visually soothing, with squared-off Japanese lanterns casting a mild glow. The menu is extensive and varied, with a permanent sushi list of about 35 fish, supplemented by a daily list of market specials.</p>
        <p>CONVIVIUM OSTERIA * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 857-1833; 68 Fifth Avenue (St. Mark's Place); $$$; Review: 10/6/04.</p>
        <p>Convivium Osteria, on the neighborhood's fringes, marries Italian and Portuguese dishes and throws in Spanish dishes for good measure. Dishes include a Portuguese seafood stew known as caldeírada de peíxe e maríscos, pasta dishes, grilled baby octopus with a corona bean salad, seafood tapas and an enormous, terrific ribeye for two.</p>
        <p>STONE PARK CAFE ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (718) 369-0082; 324 Fifth Avenue (Third Street); $$; Review 3/30/05.</p>
        <p>The cooking at this New American restaurant is careful, and the flourishes and grace notes are prudent. Among the appetizers are plenty of unexpected dishes and dishes with clever twists, like bluefish cakes garnished with a fantastic slaw that uses celery root in place of cabbage.</p>
        <p>TEMPO * [Rating: One Star]  (718) 636-2020; 256 Fifth Avenue (Carroll Street); $$; Review: 11/10/04.</p>
        <p>Tempo occupies the space that used to be Cucina, one of the pace-setters on Fifth Avenue. This restaurant, which serves Mediterranean fare, is worth a bit of talk.</p>
        <p>Pasta dishes, especially bucatini with a pignoli-pistachio pesto, are winners. Tempo makes its own gelato, which is quite good. So is a sticky date and toffee pudding.</p>
