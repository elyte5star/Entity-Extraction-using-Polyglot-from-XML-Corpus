        <p>When the lights go out at the movies, the sound of crunching popcorn and the slurping of sodas can be bad enough. But what about that annoying woman three rows back who not only leaves her cellphone on, but answers it when it rings? Not to mention that beefy guy at the end of the row who insists on narrating the onscreen action?</p>
        <p>Now, however, some moviegoers have a tool by which they can anonymously avoid confrontations with those who violate theater etiquette.</p>
        <p>Late last month, five Regal Entertainment Group cinemas around the city began arming some audience members with black plastic pagers that can be used to silently alert the theater staff about various irritations.</p>
        <p>''It empowers the guest; they love it,'' said Heather DeMatteis, the manager of Battery Park Stadium 11 in Manhattan, where the pager system has been in place since late 2005 as part of a nationwide test.</p>
        <p>The pager, currently offered to one moviegoer per show, goes to members of Regal's customer loyalty program, which offers credit for free popcorn, soft drinks and movies to frequent patrons.</p>
        <p>The device is small and light and looks like a child's toy. When a patron presses a button to alert a theater employee about a problem, a pager on an employee's hip vibrates and indicates what and where the difficulty is. The employee can then enter the seating area and deal with the problem. Although the company does not keep statistics on the number of complaints, cellphone use and talking during a movie are the most common issues, according to a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>At another Regal theater, Court Street Stadium 12 in Downtown Brooklyn, where the system was just introduced, the big offense seems to be noisy talking during the film. ''On weekends, it's loud here,'' said John Greene, who was on his way to see the horror flick ''Hostel: Part II'' a few days ago. ''The young high school kids scream, yell, talk on their phones, all that. I'd use that thing.''</p>
        <p>Bert Hubbard of Crown Heights, who had just seen the movie ''Knocked Up'' at the theater with his girlfriend, praised the gadget's discreetness.</p>
        <p>''It's like having an in-house snitch,'' said Mr. Hubbard, whose burly frame makes him appear unlikely to be intimidated but who says he thinks twice about approaching a noisy person within the dark confines of a movie theater. ''You've got to pick your battles.''</p>
