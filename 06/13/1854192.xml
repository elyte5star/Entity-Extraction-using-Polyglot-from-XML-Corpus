      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds that discovery of vast numbers of migrating animals in southern Sudan is important because it records unexpected well-being of such animals and because it creates possibility of ecotourism for war-ravaged country; urges international community to help Sudan protect this wildlife</p>

        <p>To many of us, Sudan means one thing -- the ongoing disaster called Darfur. But scientists flying over Southern Sudan -- the site of a separate civil war that finally ended in 2005 -- have discovered vast numbers of migrating animals: herds of antelope and gazelle that may rival the scale of the great migration in Serengeti.</p>
        <p>Until this recent survey, the fear was that 20 years of fighting had created a collapse of the kind seen in the Central African Republic, where you can fly low over the landscape all day long and see scarcely a single animal. But what they found instead was a river of animals moving through a river of grass, including some species that were thought to be extinct.</p>

        <p>To many of us, Sudan means one thing -- the ongoing disaster called Darfur. But scientists flying over Southern Sudan -- the site of a separate civil war that finally ended in 2005 -- have discovered vast numbers of migrating animals: herds of antelope and gazelle that may rival the scale of the great migration in Serengeti.</p>
        <p>Until this recent survey, the fear was that 20 years of fighting had created a collapse of the kind seen in the Central African Republic, where you can fly low over the landscape all day long and see scarcely a single animal. But what they found instead was a river of animals moving through a river of grass, including some species that were thought to be extinct.</p>
        <p>This discovery is important, first of all, because it records the unexpected well-being of such vast numbers of animals and of an ecosystem as a whole. But it is also important because it creates the possibility of ecotourism, and a source of employment and wealth to help balance the oil rush that is growing day by day there.</p>
        <p>Authorities in Southern Sudan have committed to protecting this wildlife. That will take some doing and international help. In a sense, the migratory herds have protected themselves simply by being migratory while more sedentary animals, like buffalo, have nearly vanished. The very absence of people throughout the south -- an artifact of the civil war -- also helped protect the animals. But now those people are returning in large numbers, as are foreign oil companies.</p>
        <p>The task is to find ways to create, within a devastated country, the tools and the education to value and protect these wild herds and their ecosystem. It is not a choice between saving people and saving wild animals. It is a matter of protecting the natural resources that allow humans and animals to thrive.</p>
