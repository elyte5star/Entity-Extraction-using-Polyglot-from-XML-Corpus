        <p>A homeless man was sentenced yesterday to 23 years in prison for fatally shooting a bridge painter who asked him to move his belongings from a Grand Central Parkway overpass during a painting job in November 2004, prosecutors said. The man, Steven Boyd, 47, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on May 7, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Boyd admitted that when the painter, James Gaviglia, 38, of Middle Village, asked him to move his makeshift shelter from an overpass in Corona, he shot him repeatedly with a pistol, then lit a cigar and waited for the police, Mr. Brown said.</p>
