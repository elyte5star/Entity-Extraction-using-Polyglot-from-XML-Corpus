        <p>An article yesterday about the high number of arrests at this year's Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan referred incorrectly to the estimated number of arrests at last year's parade. The figure of 50 to 60 arrests last year was taken from an article that ran in The Times in 2006; the estimate did not come from the New York police in the course of reporting yesterday's article. (The 2006 article cited ''at least 50'' arrests, but the Police Department disputes that figure, saying 151 people were arrested.) An article about the reaction to this year's arrests appears today on Page B3.</p>
