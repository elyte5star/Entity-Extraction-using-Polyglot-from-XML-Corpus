        <p>Freshly picked, locally grown lettuces are treasures that are here for the summer. They deliver flavor and texture that most salad greens, having been shipped across the country, barely suggest. Even iceberg lettuce is worthy of the salad bowl when it is harvested from nearby farms.</p>
        <p>Yuno's Farm in Bordentown, N.J., brings young lettuces, barely forming heads, into several Greenmarkets all season. You will find red romaine, green romaine and frisée (top); green leaf (center); and French iceberg (bottom) that is crisp and sweet. The lettuces are $8 a pound (about four small heads) at Union Square on Mondays and Fridays, Dag Hammarskjold Plaza on Wednesdays and Abingdon Square on Saturdays.</p>

        <p>Satur Farms in Cutchogue, N.Y., grows lush heads of herbaceous, velvety tender green and red butterhead lettuce, picking them daily and trucking them to several New York markets, including Fresh Direct, where they are $3.29 each, and Gourmet Garage, $3.99. Both Gourmet Garage and Fresh Direct also sell Satur Farms's spicy-sweet, densely textured field-grown mâche, which has more character than the hydroponic variety; a six-ounce package is $4.99 at Gourmet Garage and $5.99 at Fresh Direct.</p>
