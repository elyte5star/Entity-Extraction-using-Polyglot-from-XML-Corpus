        <p>CBS Chairman Rebukes Dan Rather</p>
        <p>Dan Rather was branded as a ''sexist'' yesterday by Leslie Moonves, the chairman of CBS, for comments critical of Katie Couric, his successor as the anchor of ''CBS Evening News.'' The uproar began on Monday when Mr. Rather, speaking on MSNBC by telephone, said CBS had erred in handling the evening news broadcast by ''dumbing it down, tarting it up'' and emphasizing celebrities over war coverage in ''hopes of attracting a younger audience,'' The Associated Press reported. Although he referred to Ms. Couric as a ''nice person,'' he said ''the mistake was to try to bring the 'Today' show ethos to the 'Evening News.' '' Ms. Couric, in nine months as the first woman to anchor a network news broadcast on her own, has been unable to lift ''CBS Evening News'' out of last place among the evening news programs. ''Let's give her a break,'' Mr. Moonves said at an appearance in New York where he was asked about Mr. Rather's remarks and called them ''sexist.'' He said he ''absolutely'' had confidence in Ms. Couric and the course of CBS's evening news and added that it was imperative to reach younger audiences. Unless news programs find viewers younger than 60, he said, ''the evening news will die.''</p>
        <p>Secret Clapton Concert In the Works</p>
        <p>Eric Clapton is to be paid $1.5 million to perform in late July at a private concert organized by a hedge-fund executive at the Belle Haven Club in Greenwich, Conn., according to an article to be published today by The Fairfield County Weekly. The account says that under terms of the agreement between the Creative Artists Agency, a promoter and the executive, ''no public press or announcement pre or post event is permitted.'' The agreement says the performance, to benefit the China Care Foundation, is expected to be attended by ''350 invitation-only guests.'' The host was identified as Raymond T. Dalio, the founder, president and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, which has more than $30 billion in hedge-fund assets. Besides Mr. Clapton's fee for a 60- to 70-minute show, the agreement calls for a $1 million donation to ''a charity of Mr. Clapton's choice to be paid the night of the show.'' The weekly reports that neither Mr. Dalio nor agents at Creative Artists Agency responded to calls for comment.</p>
        <p>Nigerian Author Wins Major Award</p>
        <p>Chinua Achebe, below, of Nigeria, the Charles P. Stevenson Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., was named the winner yesterday of the $118,500 (£60,000) Man Booker International Prize. The honor is awarded once every two years to a living author for a body of work that has contributed to international fiction. Nadine Gordimer, one of three members of the judging panel that chose Mr. Achebe, said his ''early work made him the father of modern African literature as an integral part of world literature.'' She added, ''He has gone on to achieve what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writer's purpose: 'a new-found utterance' for the capture of life's complexity.'' Best known for his novels ''Things Fall Apart'' (1958) and ''Anthills of the Savannah'' (1988), Mr. Achebe, 76, will receive his prize and a trophy at a ceremony on June 28 at Christ Church in Oxford, England.</p>
        <p>Disney Goes Bollywood</p>
        <p>Walt Disney Studios and the Indian company Yash Raj Films entered an agreement yesterday in Mumbai to make animated films using the voices of Bollywood stars, Agence France-Presse reported. In a statement, the companies said the stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor would provide the voices for the first one, ''Roadside Romeo,'' a fully animated Hindi-language movie including song, dance and action sequences and scheduled for release next year.</p>
        <p>Ancient Temple Saved From Modern Builders</p>
        <p>The Italian police have saved an ancient Greek temple from burial beneath the foundations of a resort hotel under construction, The Associated Press reported; the building crew had dumped or looted artifacts and was beginning to pour concrete over the ruins. Members of the art squad of the Carabinieri paramilitary police said more than 50 artifacts, including columns and mosaics, had been excavated from the site, above, near Crotone in southern Calabria, to decorate a nearby hotel complex. Other pieces had been put in a dump to be reused as construction material. Gen. Giovanni Nistri, commander of the art squad, said further construction ''would have been the final tombstone for this temple.''</p>
        <p>Farm Aid Comes To New York</p>
        <p>New York City will have a rural touch when Randalls Island becomes the site of a Farm Aid concert to benefit family farms, Reuters reported. Willie Nelson announced on Monday that ''Farm Aid 2007: A Homegrown Festival'' will take place on the island in the East River on Sept. 9. ''Farm Aid is coming to New York because your enthusiasm for family-farm food is keeping family farms on the land,'' said Mr. Nelson, who will perform with Farm Aid board members Dave Matthews, John Mellencamp and Neil Young. Since it was organized in 1985 Farm Aid has raised more than $30 million. The Randalls Island concert will be the first Farm Aid concert in New York.</p>
