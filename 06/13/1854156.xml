        <p>Appeals by Malta and Sweden for help in sharing the burden of thousands of African and Iraqi refugees streaming into the European Union were rebuffed Tuesday as union interior ministers clashed on how to solve the problem.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, 27 shipwrecked Africans said they had spent three days clinging to the tuna nets of a vessel in the Mediterranean while Malta and Libya argued over who should rescue them. The case prompted sharp criticism from Franco Frattini, the European Union commissioner in charge of migration issues, who accused Malta of putting bureaucracy before human life.</p>
        <p>Sweden expects more than 20,000 applications this year from refugees fleeing war in Iraq. Nearly 50,000 refugees leave Iraq every month, and 40,000 are expected to reach Europe this year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said.</p>
        <p>The interior ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, resisted proposals to divide illegal migrants among the 27 European Union members.</p>
        <p>''You need to have a fair allocation system, but it will be a very long road'' to get an agreement, said Wolfgang Sch√§uble, the interior minister of Germany, which holds the union's rotating presidency.</p>
        <p>Malta, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus have criticized members for a lack of solidarity in dealing with African migrants entering Europe. More than 32,000 arrived in the Canary Islands of Spain last year, and more than 6,000 have reached Malta since 2002. Many have died en route.</p>
        <p>Malta has proposed that members devise a system for migrants whose boats founder in nonunion waters to be distributed evenly among union countries. But union migration officials said it could encourage rather than deter illegal migration.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, interior ministers approved forming a pool of border guards for emergencies. But the director of the union's border control agency said that would fall short because the nearly 500 guards would be available only for emergencies and would not patrol daily around Malta or the Canary Islands, the areas with the most illegal migration.</p>
