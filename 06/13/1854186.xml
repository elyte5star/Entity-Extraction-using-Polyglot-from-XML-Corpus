        <p>Faced with criticism from privacy activists and questions from the European Union, Google announced on Tuesday that it would cut back on how long it keeps the Web search histories of users, to 18 months from 24.</p>
        <p>Search information will now be made anonymous after a year and a half, the company said in a letter addressed to a European Union privacy watchdog group, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, and posted on the company's Web site.</p>
        <p>The information, which is gathered every time Google's search engine is used, gives indications of the searcher's tastes and interests. Google shares general information on search trends, but says that it does not release this personal information outside the company.</p>
        <p>''We believe we can still address our legitimate interests in security, innovation and antifraud efforts with this shorter period,'' Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, wrote in the letter. He added that the company would ''firmly reject'' a retention period that was any shorter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said that the company faced a great lack of legal clarity, with some of its services potentially falling under European Union data retention rules that require companies to keep some records of electronic communication for up to 24 months.</p>
        <p>The move was part of a discussion that Google had begun with the group to clarify privacy questions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said that Google had been working to balance conflicting considerations in an area where the industry has taken little action.</p>
        <p>''We looked at what other companies in the industry do, and we were not able to find explicit and clear privacy policies,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>Google is committed to following United States law and European Union data protection principles, Mr. Fleischer said in the letter. He added that there were many gray areas of how to deal with privacy matters.</p>
        <p>''Retention of logs data is critical to our ability to operate and improve our services and to provide adequate security for our users,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Analysis of log data is necessary for engineers to refine search quality, to place the most popular results at the top and build new services, the company said.</p>
        <p>One such service from Google is its Spell Checker, which automatically looks at a query to see if the searcher has employed the most common spelling of a word. If an alternative spelling generates a greater number of search results, the service will ask if the searcher really meant to use that other spelling.</p>
        <p>The new policy on data retention came days after Privacy International, an advocacy group based in London, gave Google the lowest privacy protection rating of all major Internet properties.</p>
        <p>''We were disappointed with the report because it is full of numerous inaccuracies,'' Mr. Fleischer said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>He added, ''Google is open to an ongoing dialogue'' on privacy issues.''</p>
