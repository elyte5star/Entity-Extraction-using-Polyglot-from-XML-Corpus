        <p>In an effort to revive a crippled immigration bill, President Bush visited the Capitol on Tuesday to try to assure wary Senate Republicans personally that border security was a driving force behind his push for changes in immigration law.</p>
        <p>The president, intensifying his lobbying on behalf of the stalled measure, also told lawmakers he would put more emphasis on the measure's border protection elements as he tries to sell it to a skeptical public in appearances beginning this week.</p>
        <p>''We've got to convince the American people that this bill is the best way to enforce our border,'' Mr. Bush said after he concluded one of his infrequent meetings with lawmakers on their turf.</p>
        <p>The trip to the weekly Senate party luncheon -- his first since 2001 -- came on the first full day of his return from a trip to Europe, where he attended an international summit meeting while the immigration measure collapsed at home.</p>
        <p>But the president, who has made the overhaul a chief goal of his final months in office, said he was not willing to let the opportunity slip away because of stiff resistance over an approach that meshes new border protections with the chance for millions of illegal immigrants to qualify for legal residency.</p>
        <p>''The status quo is unacceptable,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that ''the time is now to move a comprehensive piece of legislation.''</p>
        <p>Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, who is chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the new focus on security measures was intended as ''a confidence-building measure'' to shore up support among Republicans uneasy with the proposal rather than convert die-hard opponents.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he changed any minds, but I think he helped those who may be on the fence who may be still trying to make a decision,'' Mr. Martinez said.</p>
        <p>Just hours before the lunch, two Georgia Republicans, Senators Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, wrote Mr. Bush and urged him to propose emergency spending on border controls to reassure Americans that safeguarding the border would come before citizenship for illegal entrants.</p>
        <p>''Such a move would show your commitment to securing the border first and to stopping the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs in our nation,'' said the letter from the two senators, who had helped draft the compromise legislation but pulled back after an outpouring of criticism from home-state voters.</p>
        <p>In a trip to Georgia two weeks ago, Mr. Bush angered critics of the bill when he suggested opponents were spreading ''empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our citizens.'' But those who attended the lunch said that the questions to the president and the exchanges were cordial and substantive and that the president did not take aim at conservatives who helped torpedo the legislation last week.</p>
        <p>''He made clear that he wasn't there to threaten anybody or do anything that would be hostile to anybody who disagrees with him,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a leading opponent of the bill. ''He was there to appeal to our sense of commitment to do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>But like several others, Mr. Sessions said that he had not been won over by Mr. Bush and that he would oppose any move to bring the legislation back quickly for a vote.</p>
        <p>Even before the president arrived with a retinue of administration officials, authors of the compromise were trying to come up with a defined list of changes to the bill that would be considered should Democrats consent to resurrecting it before the Fourth of July recess.</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders said it would be up to Mr. Bush, whose influence over Congressional Republicans has shown signs of waning, to prod skeptical members of his own party to get behind the measure.</p>
        <p>''We'll move onto immigration when they have their own act together,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, shortly after the president left the Capitol.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush was meeting with Republican senators, two cabinet officers pleaded for passage of the bill and sought to rebut criticism.</p>
        <p>One of the cabinet members, Michael Chertoff, secretary of homeland security, said the administration was willing to consider a number of proposed Republican amendments, including one that would require illegal immigrants to ''touch back'' in their home countries (or some other country) to apply for legal status.</p>
        <p>''That's doable,'' Mr. Chertoff said, referring to the proposal by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. He said the administration was consulting with senators on a package of amendments ''that might win over some additional support'' for the bill.</p>
        <p>Under the bill as it now stands, illegal immigrants who have been in this country since Jan. 1 could get legal status and special ''Z visas,'' renewable every four years. They would have to leave the United States if they wanted to apply for permanent-residence visas, or green cards.</p>
        <p>Nine conservative Republican senators, including Jim DeMint of South Carolina, sent a letter to Mr. Bush urging him to enforce border security laws already on the books, regardless of whether the Senate passes the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff said the administration had already made a commitment to meet many goals set forth in the bill, like hiring more Border Patrol agents and putting up more fence along the border with Mexico. But he said that without the bill, his agency did not have the authority to require employers to check federal and state databases to verify that employees were eligible to work in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The single most important thing we need is a mandatory employment verification system,'' Mr. Chertoff said. The system, he said, would relieve pressure on the border by reducing the incentive for unauthorized immigrants to seek jobs in this country.</p>
        <p>The other cabinet officer, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, said that failure to pass the bill would hurt the economy. ''We will see rotting fruit'' in the fields, Mr. Gutierrez said. ''We will see lawns that don't get cared for. We will see patients who don't get cared for.''</p>
        <p>At the lunch, where aides said, Mr. Bush dined on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, the president also told Republicans that he would not sign ''just any bill,'' Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi said. That comment was meant to answer a concern of critics who fear the president is so eager for a domestic achievement that he would agree to flawed legislation.</p>
        <p>Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican supporter of the plan, said the president also noted that he could be more committed to making security a central feature of the immigration law than future presidents. ''I think he made a very good point that if we fail to act, others will,'' Mr. Graham said.</p>
        <p>Still, it remained far from certain whether the president's visit -- or his renewed emphasis on border security -- would move the bill closer to passage.</p>
        <p>''It was a good give and take,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''We didn't expect anybody to stand up and holler that they had an epiphany.''</p>
