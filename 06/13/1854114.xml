        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) LAST COMIC STANDING The search for the funniest people out there goes global in this two-hour season premiere, with stops in Montreal, Sydney and London before heading back to Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Antonio and Tempe, Ariz. But first, the series's three scouts -- Alonzo Bodden, in white shirt, the Season 3 winner; ANT; and Kathleen Madigan, far left -- travel to New York to audition hopefuls for the prize of $250,000, a talent contract with NBC Universal and a half-hour comedy special.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE Tonight the 20 dancers perform, and America votes. Tomorrow, on the first results show, one man and one woman will have to hoof it back home.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) THE NEXT BEST THING: WHO IS THE GREATEST CELEBRITY IMPERSONATOR? Elvis. Celine. Liberace. Wayne. You name the entertainers; they're here, as the Las Vegas audition rounds continue in this competition for $100,000.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) AMERICAN INVENTOR Next in this talent search, budding inventors present their widgets in open casting calls in Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TBS) TYLER PERRY'S HOUSE OF PAYNE C. J. (Allen Payne), who just moved his entire family in with his uncle in this new sitcom created by Mr. Perry, learns that his house fire was the result of arson. At 9:30, he learns two painful truths about his wife.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BRAVO) TOP CHEF 3 MIAMI Fifteen aspiring chefs move into the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach for a new season of culinary challenges and cook-offs. Judges include Ted Allen, the foodie on ''Queer Eye''; Padma Lakshmi, a cookbook author and actress; Tom Colicchio, far left with the previous winners Harold Dieterle, center, and Ilan Hall, a founder of Craft Restaurants; and Gail Simmons of Food &amp; Wine magazine, in which the series's winner will be featured.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) RESCUE ME As the fourth season begins, Tommy the firefighter (Denis Leary) is suspected of setting the fire that almost killed him and is being hit on by the woman who rescued him (Jennifer Esposito).</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (SCI FI) DESTINATION TRUTH Josh Gates continues his worldwide journey for sites of paranormal activities, stopping tonight in Thailand to dredge up information on a dragonlike sea monster.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (SPIKE) GUYS CHOICE Adam Sandler, right, has been chosen the ultimate ''Guy's Guy,'' which means he gets to play host to these first annual awards honoring the sexiest women and coolest men of the past year. And he'll be roasted along the way. Those handing over the searing comments include Kevin James, Elisha Cuthbert, Mandy Moore, Andy Samberg, Artie Lange, Brittany Snow, Chris Cornell, Donnie Walhlberg, James Gandolfini, Will Ferrell and Steve-O. Styx, Mr. Sandler's favorite band; ZZ Top; Carmen Electra; and the Bombshells will perform.</p>
