        <p>U.S. Benchmarks for Iraq Unmet  Iraq's leaders have failed to agree on nearly every law that the Americans have demanded as benchmarks, despite heavy pressure, the White House and top military commanders said. Many Iraqi and American officials now question whether any substantive laws will pass before the end of the year.  A1</p>
        <p>Cricket Coach Was Not Killed  The coach of the Pakistani cricket team, who was found unconscious in his hotel room in Jamaica in March after his team was ousted from the Cricket World Cup, was not murdered as the police had previously thought but had died of unspecified natural causes, the police said.

        <p>Accidental U.S.-Afghan Clash  American-led forces killed seven Afghan policemen and wounded five more in an exchange of fire that Afghan police officials said was a result of mistaken identity.  A6</p>
        <p>Europe Plans for Refugees  Appeals by Malta and Sweden for help in sharing the burden of thousands of African and Iraqi refugees streaming into the European Union were rebuffed as the European Union's interior ministers clashed over how to solve the problem. A4</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A13-19</p>
        <p>Early Symptoms Found To Identify Ovarian Cancer  Experts have identified a set of health problems that may be symptoms of ovarian cancer, and they are urging women who have the symptoms for more than a few weeks to see their doctors. The advice is the first official recognition that the disease does cause symptoms at earlier stages in many women.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Overseas Voting Problems  Over the last six years, the Defense Department has spent more than $30 million trying to find an efficient way for American soldiers and civilians living abroad to vote in elections back home. But the Pentagon's Web-based system remains slow, confusing and plagued with security and privacy problems.</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Panel Denies Ill Workers  A federal advisory panel recommended that workers at a former nuclear weapons plant be denied immediate government compensation for illnesses the workers say they suffer as a result of years of radiation exposure at the plant.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh Fire Kills Five  Five young children from two families died in an early morning fire in Pittsburgh after their mothers left them in the home overnight with a teenage baby sitter who has not been found, the police said.  A15</p>
        <p>Bush Lobbies Republicans  Trying to revive a crippled immigration bill, President Bush visited the Capitol to try to assure wary Senate Republicans that border security was a driving force behind the immigration law.  A16</p>
        <p>Ohio School Wins Reprieve  An experimental public high school in Dayton that has had success in sending low-income students to college will become a charter school under the control of the University of Dayton, the school district said.</p>
        <p>A17</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-8</p>
        <p>City Spurs Big Jump On State Math Scores  Math scores for students across New York State improved significantly in every grade this year, powered by sizable gains in New York City, according to results of the annual state math exam released by state officials.  A1</p>
        <p>A Lightning Rod on Immigration  Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, injects himself into the issue of illegal immigration often and aggressively, and has been called ''arguably the most formidable elected official in Long Island history.''  A1</p>
        <p>Budget Deal Offers Tax Break  New York City taxpayers would get a larger-than-expected break on their property taxes under a $59 billion budget deal that city leaders announced. The pact, which comes weeks earlier than usual, would also use a record $4.4 billion surplus to eliminate taxes on clothing and shoes and increase library service to six days a week.  B1</p>
