        <p>ANTAR--Danielle. Your 32nd Birthday. It has been 14 years, how I wish I can see you, hug you and kiss you, as I say Happy Birthday, hear you laugh and grin as you roll your eyes and say, ''Mommy I love you''. I cherish and keep that love and the memories within me. I miss your love, warmth, wisdom and all that made you you. I just miss you. Happy Birthday, Pumpkin. I love you so. Me.</p>
