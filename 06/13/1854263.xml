        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer said yesterday that he was open to making the medical use of marijuana legal in New York, reversing a position he took during the campaign. It was unclear, however, whether the Legislature would pass such a bill. ''There was a moment during a debate last summer, I think, where I spoke more negatively of it based upon what I understood the medical considerations to be,'' the governor said. ''I've taken a hard look at it over the past number of months, and I'm open to signing a bill if it's properly structured.'' The Democrat-led Assembly is expected to pass a bill before the session ends next week, but it is unclear whether it will be taken up in the Republican-led Senate. ''It's a bill that is under review, but it's not right now on our radar,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader.</p>
