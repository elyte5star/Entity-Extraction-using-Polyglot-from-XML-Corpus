        <p>Frank Sinatra's ''You Make Me Feel So Young'' might seem a peculiar choice to open a memorial celebration.

        <p>Before a packed audience in the Majestic Theater on Broadway yesterday, an audience that included actors, singers, mayors and socialites, Miss Carlisle, who died at 96, was recalled as a person whose elegance, poise and good humor embodied a kind of fairy tale New York, where she led riders on a crosstown bus in a chorus of Christmas carols, wore opera gloves to youth basketball games and had a different party on the agenda every night of the week.</p>

        <p>Frank Sinatra's ''You Make Me Feel So Young'' might seem a peculiar choice to open a memorial celebration. But if the person being remembered is Kitty Carlisle Hart, the entertainer and culture grande dame who died in April but was singing the standards in cabaret bars and on stages well into her 90s, it makes plenty of sense.</p>
        <p>Before a packed audience in the Majestic Theater on Broadway yesterday, an audience that included actors, singers, mayors and socialites, Miss Carlisle, who died at 96, was recalled as a person whose elegance, poise and good humor embodied a kind of fairy tale New York, where she led riders on a crosstown bus in a chorus of Christmas carols, wore opera gloves to youth basketball games and had a different party on the agenda every night of the week.</p>
        <p>''Kitty always had a beau, sometimes more than one at a time,'' said Barbara Walters, one of the speakers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Walters said that Miss Carlisle, through her appearances on game shows like ''To Tell the Truth,'' introduced a look of elegance and sophistication to millions of Americans. ''Would that we had more of that today,'' Ms. Walters said.</p>
        <p>Manhattan, where Miss Carlisle established her show business career and kept her social calendar, was her natural habitat.</p>
        <p>''She embodied the dream of New York, a place where a girl could pick her name out of a phone book and later see it in lights,'' said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, alluding to the fact that Catherine Conn (her name at birth) picked the name Carlisle out of a phone book.</p>
        <p>She was more than just a representative of the George Gershwin-Jerome Kern era of New York she lived through. She was, as Mr. Bloomberg put it, a one-woman show in her own right.</p>
        <p>Her children, Catherine and Christopher Hart, told stories of her going on a waterslide at 93 and playing gin rummy with her grandchildren -- for money. A clip was played of Miss Carlisle on the ''Today'' show at 92, demonstrating the strenuous daily exercise routine she kept up to keep her legs looking good.</p>
        <p>''My mom used to joke,'' Ms. Hart said, '' 'When I lose my vanity, shoot me.' ''</p>
        <p>Mario Cuomo, one of the five governors under whom she worked on the New York State Council of the Arts, described her indefatigable ability to get what she wanted in Albany: namely, more funding for the arts.</p>
        <p>''She used every skill, every artifice, every con that a beautiful woman could,'' he said, going on to call her ''the most effective and inspiring champion of the arts in the history of New York State.''</p>
        <p>But her show business career took center stage at the memorial. Between clips of her singing with Bing Crosby, entertaining at home with her husband, the playwright Moss Hart, or mugging along with the Marx Brothers in ''A Night at the Opera,'' the singers Kristin Chenoweth, KT Sullivan and Michael Feinstein performed songs they associated with her. At the end of the service, all of the singers came on stage for a sing-along of Irving Berlin's ''Always.''</p>
        <p>David Lewis, Miss Carlisle's longtime piano accompanist, played Stephen Sondheim's ''Old Friends'' -- one of the first songs she and Mr. Lewis learned together -- and Gershwin's ''The Man I Love.''</p>
        <p>The reason for that one, Mr. Lewis explained, was something she had told him once: ''When I die and there's a memorial service,'' he recalled her saying, ''I want you to go to the piano and play 'The Man I Love' in my key. If I don't come out on that stage, then you'll know I'm gone.''</p>
