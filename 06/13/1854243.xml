        <p>The ''are we there yet?'' of a family trip is magnified -- or condensed -- into two acts in Anastasia Traina's play ''From Riverdale to Riverhead.'' The title is purely descriptive; it denotes the journey of three achingly stereotyped sisters and their niece to visit the son of one of the sisters, Louise, in jail.

        <p>From Riverdale To Riverhead  Studio Dante  257 West 29th Street, Chelsea  (212) 868-4444  Through June 30</p>
        <p>The ''are we there yet?'' of a family trip is magnified -- or condensed -- into two acts in Anastasia Traina's play ''From Riverdale to Riverhead.'' The title is purely descriptive; it denotes the journey of three achingly stereotyped sisters and their niece to visit the son of one of the sisters, Louise, in jail. Virtually the entire action of the piece, which opened last weekend at Studio Dante, consists of four women riding, talking, bickering and crying in a car.</p>
        <p>Part of the point, it seems, is that everyone's teeth are set on edge, and the director, Nick Sandow, and the four actresses and the playwright achieve this so well that you are ready to scream by the time the play has gone off the road (in just about every sense) at the end of the evening.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has seen one of the ''Saturday Night Live'' ''Bronx Beat'' sketches, in which Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler grill a hapless guest without letting him get a word in edgewise, will have an idea of the characters (shallow) and the tone (strident) of the three sisters, Louise, Stella and Fannie. The comparison is apt because the play repeatedly strikes the note of a comedy skit until it has the audience roaring with laughter at utterly unfunny statements about death or the cruelty that happens within families (the work's central topic).</p>
        <p>Sharon Angela (familiar from ''The Sopranos'') is the driver, Stella, a brassy, foul-mouthed but competent realist. Catherine Curtin is Fannie, whose laborious mispronunciations of standard words are the comic signal of aggressive dumbness. Angelica Torn is Louise, a self-involved ditz prone to loud outbursts of hysterical self-pity at finding herself in her current predicament.</p>
        <p>The straight woman to this trio is Rosie, the daughter of their late brother and raised by Louise as her own. As played by Bess Rous, Rosie is a lovely, quirky, luminous, uncertain young artist subjected to increasing abuse from her aunts, especially her adoptive mother, as the play unsubtly turns up its volume.</p>
        <p>There may well be people as egomaniacal, stupid and ridiculous as these three sisters. But they are not quite the stuff of comedy, and for all of the easy laughs, watching them abuse Rosie, verbally and finally physically, is not quite funny. Nor is it quite credible. The denouement takes the characters well beyond comedy into cruel and mercifully unbelievable farce.</p>
