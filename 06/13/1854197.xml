        <p>Mr. Leonhardt's inclusion of knee replacements in his examples of ''medically questionable care'' runs contrary to many published reports by the National Institutes of Health and other reputable organizations that reaffirm that knee replacements are highly successful surgical procedures that permit millions of disabled Americans to regain their lives and walk without pain.</p>

        <p>Re ''Health Care as if Costs Didn't Matter,'' by David Leonhardt (Economix column, June 6):</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonhardt's inclusion of knee replacements in his examples of ''medically questionable care'' runs contrary to many published reports by the National Institutes of Health and other reputable organizations that reaffirm that knee replacements are highly successful surgical procedures that permit millions of disabled Americans to regain their lives and walk without pain.</p>
        <p>The evidence about lumbar fusions is currently being discussed and evaluated by an N.I.H.-financed research grant. We are supportive of efforts to critically evaluate, with evidence-based medicine, the optimal use of all medical and surgical procedures and practices, including lumbar fusions.</p>
        <p>Orthopedic surgeons are committed to ensuring that the American public has access to high-quality, affordable health care and has the facts about orthopedic surgical procedures that are medically necessary.</p>

        <p>The writers are, respectively, president of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons; president of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons; president of the Knee Society; and president of the Scoliosis Research Society.</p>
