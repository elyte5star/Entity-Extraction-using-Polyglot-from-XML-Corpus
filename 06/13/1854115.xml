        <p>Chunky peanut butter cookies ($2.50) are sandwiched with peanut butter filling; Valrhona brownies ($3) are dense and fudgy. Ice creams, including a wickedly intense caramel, are scooped into freshly made cones ($3 to $5). Right now her strawberry-rhubarb tartlets ($5 each) are best sellers. But her almond shortbreads ($1.50 for two) are all you need for an elegant dessert with some berries and a glass of Champagne. Trois Pommes is at 260 Fifth Avenue (Carroll Street), (718) 230-3119.</p>
