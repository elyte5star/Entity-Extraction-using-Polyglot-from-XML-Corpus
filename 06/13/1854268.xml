        <p>A salesman for a software consulting company has admitted stealing confidential company information and giving it to a competitor, federal prosecutors said yesterday. The salesman, Louis Giuffre, 46, of Lake Grove in Suffolk County, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court on Monday to interstate transportation of stolen property, said Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Giuffre admitted that while working for the consulting company, Netsoft, last summer, he sent confidential information to a rival company by e-mail, Mr. Garcia said. Prosecutors said the competitor ultimately won a contract that Netsoft had been trying to secure. Mr. Giuffre faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in September, prosecutors said.</p>
