        <p>The Wall Street Journal, already roiled by a proposed takeover by Rupert Murdoch, will announce today a major newsroom shake-up, including the reassignment and replacement of several top editors, officials there say.</p>
        <p>The reorganization represents a bid by the managing editor, Marcus E. Brauchli, who took the top job in the newsroom just a month ago, to put his stamp on the upper echelons of one of the nation's most respected and widely read newspapers. A spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Company, The Journal's parent company, declined to comment on any planned changes.</p>
        <p>The newsroom announcement will come on the day that the Bancroft family, which owns a controlling interest in Dow Jones, is expected to make a new proposal to Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation on safeguarding The Journal's editorial independence in the event of a sale. The Bancrofts' goal is to keep the appointment of The Journal's top editors out of Mr. Murdoch's hands.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Brauchli's reorganization, John Bussey, a deputy managing editor who has been based in Hong Kong, will lose that title, according to Journal officials, who insisted that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the changes. He has been offered a position as a columnist, but has not decided if he will accept it and is continuing to discuss his next assignment.</p>
        <p>Those officials said Edward Felsenthal, another deputy managing editor who oversees the ''soft'' sections like Personal Journal and Pursuits, is also expected to lose his title. His next assignment is not clear.</p>
        <p>Both men are in their 40's and had been considered rising stars.</p>
        <p>Daniel Hertzberg, the senior deputy managing editor, will become the top editor of The Journal's Europe and Asia editions, and will be based in Brussels. Mr. Hertzberg, who is in his early 60's and has been the second-ranking newsroom editor, was once seen as a leading contender for Mr. Brauchli's job.</p>
        <p>William S. Grueskin, the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal Online, will be promoted to deputy managing editor of the newspaper, with a broad responsibility over news coverage in both the print Journal and on the Web site. He will also oversee the domestic bureaus.</p>
        <p>The shake-up continues a period of transition that began last year and has included the retirements of some of Dow Jones's longtime leaders -- including Peter R. Kann, the chairman and chief executive, and Paul Steiger, The Journal's managing editor -- and could culminate in a sale to News Corporation.</p>
        <p>The Bancroft family initially rejected Mr. Murdoch's $5 billion bid, but later agreed to consider a sale. Many family members, who take great pride in The Journal's editorial quality, disdain the work of News Corporation media outlets like the Fox News Channel and The New York Post, which they see as politically slanted and overly devoted to celebrity gossip and crime.</p>
        <p>In a June 4 meeting with Mr. Murdoch and others from News Corporation, Bancroft family members and advisers said that if they agreed to sell, they wanted to set up a control board with exclusive power to hire and fire The Journal's top editors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch countered that he would accept a control board like the one put in place when he bought The Times of London in 1981. There, the News Corporation chooses the top editor, who must then be approved by a group of independent directors who are not chosen by the company. But that arrangement is widely seen as having failed to keep Mr. Murdoch from shaping The Times's news pages as he sees fit.</p>
        <p>Since a family meeting Monday, the three family members who sit on the Dow Jones board and their advisers have refined their proposal, which they expect to present to News Corporation today. ''The question everyone had is how enforceable it's going to be, in light of what went on in London,'' a family member said.</p>
        <p>Family members say the plan will call for a family-appointed board, which would name both the managing editor and the editorial page editor, who would have the power to fill all the positions below them.</p>
        <p>The family is not yet prepared to say whom it would put on such a board, but family members said yesterday that they were leaning toward current and former Journal employees -- including Mr. Steiger, the former managing editor; the publisher, L. Gordon Crovitz; and Paul Gigot, the editorial page editor -- rather than outsiders.</p>
        <p>Some critics of The London Times arrangement said that one of its weaknesses was that the independent directors had few connections to journalism, giving them less incentive to stand up to Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>The Bancrofts have debated having one board or two: one to pick the leader of the newsroom and the other to choose the editorial page editor. Family members and people close to them said yesterday that it was not clear how the matter had been resolved -- in keeping with Bancroft practice, they said, the three family members on the board revealed little detail -- but they said they believed that a single board would be the choice.</p>
        <p>There had also been some discussion within the Bancroft family of proposing to give the control board some power over newsroom budgets, and again, family members said it was not clear to them what would be in the proposal given to Mr. Murdoch. But members and family advisers have argued that the strongest plan is the simplest one, and that in any case, it would be unrealistic to think that News Corporation would agree to give up financial control.</p>
        <p>In the newsroom, the changes at the top will be fairly comprehensive. Alan Murray, an assistant managing editor, will move to the Web site with responsibility for video reports and the relationship with CNBC.</p>
        <p>Michael W. Miller, the Page 1 editor, will be promoted to deputy managing editor, and will continue overseeing Page 1, and get other coverage, in particular the ''business of life'' sections. Michael Williams, editor of The Wall Street Journal Europe, will take his place as Page 1 editor of the United States edition. Another deputy managing editor, Alix M. Freedman, will keep her job.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 15, 2007, Friday  An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a reorganization of the newsroom at The Wall Street Journal misstated the middle initial of its managing editor. He is Marcus W. Brauchli, not Marcus E.</p>
