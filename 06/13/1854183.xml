        <p>Bush Lobbies Senate on Immigration Bill  In an effort to revive a crippled immigration bill, President Bush visited the Capitol to try to assure Senate Republicans that border security was a driving force behind his push for changes in the law. The president pressed his case in a visit to the weekly Senate party luncheon -- his first since 2001 -- then appeared with Senators Trent Lott, left, and Mitch McConnell.</p>
        <p>PAGE A16</p>
        <p>Overseas Voting Problems  The Defense Department has spent millions trying to find an efficient way for Americans living abroad to vote in elections back home, but its Web-based system is plagued by problems.</p>
        <p>PAGE A19</p>
        <p>Reversal on Coach's Death  The Jamaican police said Bob Woolmer, the coach of the Pakistani cricket team who died during the World Cup tournament in Jamaica, was not murdered, as they had previously announced, but instead died of natural causes.</p>
        <p>PAGE A12</p>
        <p>Dining Whole Hog  A counterculture of chefs, perhaps reacting to decades of sushi and small plates and grazing, is serving fatty fare like deviled eggs on fried pork jowl. Critic's Notebook by Frank Bruni.</p>
        <p>DINING, PAGE F1</p>
        <p>Big Ad Push by Romney  Mitt Romney has stepped up what is already the most expensive early advertising push in a presidential campaign, an effort credited with helping vault him to the lead in the Republican field in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. He has spent $4 million on television advertising since February.</p>
        <p>PAGE A19</p>
        <p>Property Tax Break Highlights Budget Deal  New York City taxpayers would get a larger-than-expected break on their property taxes under a $59 billion budget deal that city leaders announced last night. The pact, which comes weeks earlier than usual, would also use a record $4.4 billion surplus to eliminate taxes on clothing and shoes and increase library service to six days a week.</p>
        <p>PAGE B1</p>
        <p>Sudan Agrees to Peace Force  After resisting for months, Sudan has agreed to a joint United Nations and African Union force of nearly 20,000 peacekeepers in Darfur, its western province and the site of one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</p>
        <p>PAGE A3</p>
        <p>Spurs Close In on Title  San Antonio prevented the Cleveland star LeBron James from attempting a potential game-tying shot in the final seconds and held on to win, 75-72, in Game 3 of the best-of-seven N.B.A. finals. The Spurs lead, 3-0, with Game 4 tomorrow in Cleveland.</p>
