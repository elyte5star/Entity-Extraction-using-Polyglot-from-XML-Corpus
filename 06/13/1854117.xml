        <p>Open Now</p>
        <p>KyoChon Chicken This Korean 1,050-restaurant chain, said to be the inspiration for the wave of Korean fried chicken spots in New York and on the West Coast, has opened its first New York outpost. Two more will open in Bayside, Queens, in a few weeks: 156-50 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, (718) 939-9292.</p>
        <p>Public House A group of Irish pub owners is responsible for this vast new venue with a 100-foot bar and few surprises on the menu: 140 East 41st Street, (212) 682-3710.</p>
        <p>Lola Gayle and Thomas Patrick-Odeen have relocated their restaurant and lounge from Chelsea to SoHo. Jennifer Printz is the executive chef; the gospel brunch survived: 15 Watts Street (Thompson Street), (212) 675-6700.</p>
        <p>Thai Select Parkpoom Watanasuparp and Pisit Charoonsriswad have added this fusion spot to their string of Thai restaurants: 472 Ninth Avenue (36th Street), (212) 695-9930.</p>
        <p>Opening This Week</p>
        <p>Pó On Friday, a Brooklyn clone of this Greenwich Village restaurant will open: 276 Smith Street (DeGraw Street), Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 875-1980.</p>
        <p>After 8.5 is another way of writing ''after 8:30 p.m.,'' which is when the lounge area of Brasserie 81/2 magically turns into this dessert destination, starting tonight. The pastry chef Martin Howard's confections, many meant for sharing, are on the menu with sweet cocktails and wines: 9 West 57th Street, (212) 829-0812.</p>
        <p>Closed</p>
        <p>Pair of 8's Realizing he could not count on an investor for an infusion of cash, last week Ron Didner pulled the plug on his Upper West Side restaurant after about a year and a half.</p>
        <p>Looking Ahead</p>
        <p>Madison &amp; Vine Mark Grossich, who owns the Campbell Apartment in Grand Central Terminal, is expanding into the restaurant business. He has taken over what was Branzini in the Library Hotel, which he will open in August as this American bistro and wine bar. He also runs Bookmarks Bar in the hotel: 299 Madison Avenue (41st Street), no phone yet.</p>
        <p>William Beaver House This condominium, being developed by the hotelier André Balazs and others, will have a 160-seat restaurant, opening late next year, which will also provide room service. The restaurant will be run by Giorgio DeLuca, a founder of Dean &amp; DeLuca and an owner of Giorgione, in partnership with Mr. Balazs: 15 William Street (at Beaver Street).</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move</p>
        <p>Patrick O'Connell, who opened the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va., with Reinhardt Lynch nearly 30 years ago, has bought out his partner and is now the sole owner.</p>
        <p>Timothy Reardon, who most recently was running the kitchen at Nice Matin, is now the executive chef at Barbounia, which has a new owner, Isaac Kestenberg.</p>
