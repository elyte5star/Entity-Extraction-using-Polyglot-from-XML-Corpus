        <p>One of the most ambitious tonal mash-ups in memory, ''Noriko's Dinner Table'' is a domestic comedy, a bloody psychological thriller and a comment on intergenerational tension and the fragility of identity. It's also a sort of sequel to ''Suicide Club,'' written and directed by the same filmmaker, Sion Sono, that replays its predecessor's key event from a new vantage point.</p>
        <p>The five-chapter, chronologically scrambled plot centers on an unhappy family from Toyokawa, Japan, that loses two teenage daughters, Noriko (Kazue Fukiishi) and Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), to the Family Circle, a Tokyo cult that dismantles its members' ''false'' personalities and rents them to clients for elaborate role-playing.</p>

        <p>One of the most ambitious tonal mash-ups in memory, ''Noriko's Dinner Table'' is a domestic comedy, a bloody psychological thriller and a comment on intergenerational tension and the fragility of identity. It's also a sort of sequel to ''Suicide Club,'' written and directed by the same filmmaker, Sion Sono, that replays its predecessor's key event from a new vantage point.</p>
        <p>The five-chapter, chronologically scrambled plot centers on an unhappy family from Toyokawa, Japan, that loses two teenage daughters, Noriko (Kazue Fukiishi) and Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), to the Family Circle, a Tokyo cult that dismantles its members' ''false'' personalities and rents them to clients for elaborate role-playing.</p>
        <p>The film's attitude toward its characters is more complex than this synopsis suggests. The cult's figurehead, Kumiko (Tsugumi), is depicted as both a sociopath and a visionary battling bourgeois complacency. And the movie mocks the girls' father, Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), a feature reporter, for his sense of entitlement, but it also respects his grief and rage.</p>
        <p>This 159-minute feature doesn't quite cohere. Mr. Sono's direction is haphazard; he oversells the first half's whimsical touches (including fourth-wall-breaking compositions too reminiscent of Wes Anderson's movies) and the second half's spiral-of-doom emoting. Still, the movie is worth seeing, if only to experience a small story with impossibly grand ambitions.</p>
        <p>Noriko's Dinner Table  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Written (in Japanese, with English subtitles) and directed by Sion Sono; director of photography, Souhei Tanigawa; edited by Juniichi Ito; music by Tomoki Hasegawa; art director, Toru Fujita; released by Tidepoint Pictures. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 159 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Kazue Fukiishi (Noriko Shimabara), Tsugumi (Kumiko), Ken Mitsuishi (Tetsuzo Shimabara), Yuriko Yoshitaka (Yuka Shimabara) and Shirou Namiki (Ikeda).</p>
