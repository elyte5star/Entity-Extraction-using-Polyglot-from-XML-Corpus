        <p>An obituary on June 5 about Samuel A. Garrison III, the chief Republican counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, misstated the date of the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. It was Aug. 9, 1974 -- not Aug. 8, which was the date he announced that he would resign effective at noon the following day. Also, the obituary referred incorrectly to the three articles of impeachment passed by the Judiciary Committee. Only one article -- not all three -- charged Mr. Nixon with obstruction of justice. The others charged abuse of power and defiance of committee subpoenas.</p>
