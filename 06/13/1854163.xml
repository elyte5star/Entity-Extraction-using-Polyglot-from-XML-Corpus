        <p>No longer in charge of writing spending bills since they lost their majority, House Republicans are unleashing a previously unseen indignation at the pet projects that individual lawmakers attach to such bills.</p>
        <p>House Republicans on Tuesday slowed passage of the $37.4 billion homeland security appropriations bill by unveiling a lengthy list of amendments to strike the projects, or earmarks, from the bill. Although no one expects the amendments to pass -- and some seek only to prevent speculative future earmarks -- the Republican leaders vowed to continue their delaying tactics on other spending measures expected to follow.</p>
        <p>''We are prepared to make our case as aggressively as possible for the rest of the week and beyond,'' said Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader.</p>
        <p>The volume of earmarks exploded under Republican control and played roles in several corruption scandals. Lawmakers, often acting anonymously, exploited the earmark process to steer federal spending to cronies or contributors.</p>
        <p>In January, the House passed rules ending the anonymity, but Republicans say the new majority is cloaking the process in secrecy. Citing a heavy workload, Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the appropriations committee, has said the staff will not have time to review some 32,000 earmark requests before the bills are sent to the House floor, so he plans to insert them later, during the House and Senate conference and right before final approval of each bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obey said this week that he would disclose a list of earmarks in August, before the conferences begin, so that lawmakers have time to review and question them, but Republicans derided that idea.</p>
        <p>''David Obey's going to put this list out and who's going to decide? David Obey. All by himself,'' Mr. Boehner said Tuesday in a radio interview. ''I think the process is being undermined -- the interest of the American people is being subverted -- because this is not going to happen on the House floor where it should happen.''</p>
        <p>Members of both parties have complained that anonymous earmarks are prone to abuse. But conservative voters also oppose earmarks because they add to federal spending.</p>
        <p>The White House said Tuesday that President Bush would veto the House homeland security spending bill in any event because it exceeded the his budget by about 6 percent.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders complained less about earmarks when they controlled the House. Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, was often the lone member campaigning to strike specific earmarks, and the Republican leaders almost always overruled him.</p>
