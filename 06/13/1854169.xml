        <p>Two months after the North Carolina attorney general dismissed sexual assault charges against three former Duke University lacrosse players, the prosecutor who brought the case found himself in a crowded courtroom Tuesday, facing charges that could lead to his own disbarment.</p>
        <p>Michael B. Nifong, the Durham district attorney, was portrayed by Katherine Jean, a state attorney prosecuting the ethics case, as a politically motivated, overzealous prosecutor who made false statements to the public, news media, defense lawyers and the court in bringing a case with virtually no credible evidence.</p>
        <p>''The harm done to these three young men and their families and the justice system of North Carolina is devastating,'' Ms. Jean said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong's lawyer, David B. Freedman, responded that the ethics case was not about the weaknesses of the rape case, but primarily focused on whether Mr. Nifong had asked a laboratory director to hide DNA evidence. Mr. Freedman acknowledged in opening statements that some of Mr. Nifong's public statements ''clearly were outlandish'' -- for instance, he called the Duke lacrosse team ''a bunch of hooligans'' -- but denied he had said anything knowingly false or politically motivated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong, 58, a 29-year career prosecutor who was running for election when the case arose in March 2006, is expected to take the stand this week. He sat expressionless during the opening remarks, often holding his chin and cheek by thumb and forefinger. His wife, teenage son, brother and sister sat behind him.</p>
        <p>Two of the three former students' mothers watched opening arguments, with a group of defense lawyers and other supporters whose insistence of innocence had been upheld in April by the state attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, who called Mr. Nifong a ''rogue prosecutor.''</p>
        <p>The ethics charges were filed by the North Carolina State Bar, a state agency, asserting that Mr. Nifong hid and lied about DNA evidence and that his pretrial comments inflamed the community and prejudiced the defendants.</p>
        <p>While the ethics charges are limited to certain areas, the witness list shows it will be putting the whole case on trial, at least to try to show Mr. Nifong knew some of his public comments were false. For instance, he repeatedly said he was certain a rape had occurred.</p>
        <p>Benjamin W. Himan, the Durham detective who was lead investigator on the case, said in testimony for the ethics prosecutors on Tuesday that Mr. Nifong had acknowledged to him that the case was weak and relied on the word of a woman hired to strip at a lacrosse team party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Himan said he had responded with disbelief when he learned that after a month of inconclusive investigation, Mr. Nifong planned to indict two students. ''With what?'' Mr. Himan said he responded. At that point, he said, the police did not even know whether one suspect had been at the lacrosse team party. (It turned out he was there but left before any rape could have possibly happened.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Himan also said he was ''shocked'' and ''upset'' that an investigator for the district attorney later interviewed the accuser by himself, not inviting him as the police investigator. When he read the results of that interview, Mr. Himan said, ''It didn't make any sense to what she had previously told us.''</p>
        <p>Joseph B. Cheshire, a defense lawyer involved with the case, said in an interview later that Mr. Himan's testimony was ''chilling'' and showed the potentially unchecked power of the state to destroy peoples' lives even if the evidence did not exist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman, one of two lawyers for Mr. Nifong, said after the hearing that he looked forward to cross-examining Mr. Himan on Wednesday and presenting his side of the case -- including testimony from Mr. Nifong -- later in the week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nifong declined comment.</p>
        <p>A decision on the ethics charges may come by Friday or Saturday and could result in penalties as severe as disbarment.</p>
        <p>In coming weeks, Mr. Nifong is also facing two separate reviews by Superior Court judges, one on whether to remove him as district attorney, the other on whether he lied in court describing DNA evidence.</p>
        <p>The case was overlaid with charges of racism and class privilege because the stripper was black and poor, inflamed the community and much of the nation.</p>
        <p>Victoria Peterson, a black activist from Durham, was ejected from the courtroom and courthouse Tuesday after she accosted one mother during the lunch break and said people still thought her son did something wrong and should have stood trial.</p>
