        <p>A prisoner serving 40 years for raping a 12-year-old girl in 1993 got his wish, but it was not what he intended. The prisoner, Culberson Henry, applied for a retesting of the evidence under a 2001 law allowing inmates claiming wrongful conviction to petition for DNA review. The request was granted last year and the results confirmed his guilt, reported Craig Watkins, district attorney of Dallas County, where 13 prisoners were recently exonerated after DNA testing. ''Equally important,'' Mr. Watkins said, it works the other way, too.</p>
