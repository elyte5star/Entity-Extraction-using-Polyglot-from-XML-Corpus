        <p>Re ''Judges Say U.S. Can't Hold Man as 'Combatant' '' (front page, June 12):</p>
        <p>The Justice Department's response to the ruling that Ali al-Marri must have his day in court has been to recount the allegations against Mr. Marri. If the evidence against him is so strong, why does the Justice Department seek to avoid the scrutiny of a trial? If the evidence is not so strong, it is all the more important that the evidence be tested in court.</p>

        <p>For our Justice Department to imply that ''clearly guilty'' defendants do not require the niceties of a trial is chilling.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As an American, I'm pleased that the court ruled against President Bush in favor of the Constitution. Until this decade, the protections of due process and habeas corpus have been part of the American form of democracy.</p>
        <p>Although these protections are technically still ''on the books,'' they have been ignored by Mr. Bush and have therefore become, de facto, withdrawn from federal law.</p>
        <p>Because President Bush (and to some extent, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales) believes in the imperial presidency, and because he feels free to ignore the law, I fear that the Court of Appeals ruling will have no effect.</p>
        <p>Even though, legally, the courts can check and balance the executive branch of the government, Mr. Bush has already shown that he can reinterpret court rulings to his own liking (just as he has shown, through his ''signing statements,'' that he can reinterpret legislation to his liking).</p>
