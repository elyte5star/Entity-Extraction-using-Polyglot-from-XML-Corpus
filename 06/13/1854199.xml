        <p>Re ''One Last Family Gathering: You Eat, You Talk, It's Over,'' by Alessandra Stanley (The TV Watch, front page, June 11):</p>
        <p>I'm not mad at David Chase, creator of ''The Sopranos,'' for leaving Tony in a diner at the end, alive, and eating onion rings with Carmela and the kids (let's believe that Meadow makes it to her seat).</p>
        <p>Where else could the story have closed more compassionately than at a small Formica table?</p>
        <p>Even more chilling than the series' gruesome violence was the vast, sparkling loneliness of the Sopranos' huge dining table and kitchen, one of the saddest backdrops I've ever seen on stage or screen.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The last episode of ''The Sopranos'' is neither a prank nor a joke.</p>
        <p>I believe that David Chase's brilliant ending is in the mind of Tony Soprano, whose world goes dark at that moment.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''TV Writers Were Also Watching 'Sopranos' '' (Arts pages, June 12):</p>
        <p>Now we know how ''The Sopranos'' ends -- the author goes into witness protection in France.</p>
