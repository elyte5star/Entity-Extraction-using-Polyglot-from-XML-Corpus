        <p>An experimental public high school in Dayton that has had success in sending low-income students to college will become a charter school under the control of the University of Dayton, the school district has decided.</p>
        <p>The district is slashing $30 million from its budget after voters rejected a tax levy in May. The cuts jeopardized, among many other things, the experimental school, the Dayton Early College Academy. The school board plans to close two schools, cut 200 jobs and end transportation for its high school students.</p>
        <p>The move to charter-school status gives leaders of the four-year-old academy hope that they can preserve its unorthodox model for drawing average students into accelerated classes. But it has also left public education advocates frustrated by the system's inability to fully finance alternatives to failing traditional schools. All 32 students in the academy's first graduating class are going to college, most on scholarship.</p>
        <p>''Innovative schools that are excellent performers are not given the capacity to thrive under our current model of finance,'' said Greg Harris, a public policy officer with KnowledgeWorks, a Cincinnati foundation that provided start-up financing for the academy. ''It's a system that disproportionately relies on local property taxes. A levy fails, and all the hard work falls by the wayside.''</p>
        <p>As a charter school, the academy will have to conform to the district's performance benchmarks but will control how to allocate public money through a university-appointed governing board. It can also commingle tax dollars with money it raises privately without sharing the money with district schools.</p>
        <p>The school's test scores and attendance record will continue to count toward the district's overall ranking, said Yvonne Isaacs, the school board president.</p>
        <p>The academy still faces huge financial hurdles, including the loss of public money for 8 of its 19 teachers. A top priority for the university is raising money to rehire at least some of those teachers, said Thomas J. Lasley II, the dean of the School of Education at the university and a founder of the academy.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a model that represents real potential for other urban districts to look at,'' Professor Lasley said. ''We still think it's too early to tell, but if a large percentage of these kids stay in college, I'm going to run the victory flag up the flagpole.''</p>
        <p>The school must also find common ground with the teachers' union, which may contest the academy's plan to retain and hire teachers without regard to seniority rules. Those rules would require the academy to replace eight of the remaining teachers with tenured teachers from elsewhere in the district who are not trained in the experimental curriculum.</p>
