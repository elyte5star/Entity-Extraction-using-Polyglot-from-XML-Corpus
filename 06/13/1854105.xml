        <p>THE rhythms of life have changed so much that the idea of shelling peas for a weeknight meal is pretty much out of the question. A weekend leisure activity, perhaps, but for dinner on a Wednesday? Let's get real.</p>
        <p>Which is why it is so delightful that food vendors of all types, from market stands to supermarkets, now stock fresh spring peas, out of the pod, bright and not too starchy. When I first started seeing these a couple of weeks ago, I pounced, and combined them with crab to make a fast and quite tasty salad in less time than it would have taken me to shell the peas.</p>
        <p>There are options other than peas, of course. Fava beans work equally well, but it's even more important to find them peeled, because now you're getting into real nuisance territory: peeling more than a few favas is going to take a lot of time.</p>
        <p>Next best is chopped snow or snap peas: the peas should be young and tender so the pods are not too stringy. Poach them just a little longer than you would peas, but no more than a minute.</p>
        <p>You can even use frozen peas (or edamame) and turn this into a year-round dish. The taste isn't the same, but you can still produce a fine salad.</p>
        <p>All fresh-picked crab is precooked; otherwise, the meat is too liquid to remove from the shell. Fresh crab meat does not have a long shelf life, but it has the best flavor.</p>
        <p>Canned pasteurized crab, which is sometimes sold as ''fresh'' because it has not been frozen, keeps for months, as does frozen crab. Between the two of these I'd choose frozen, but I'm not sure I could tell the difference blindfolded.</p>
        <p>On the East Coast, fresh crab meat is usually from the wonderful blue crab; it's expensive but not difficult to find. On the West Coast, it will almost always be from the exquisite Dungeness, which is less expensive, more widely available and, if anything, even better, in my opinion.</p>
        <p>You can also make this salad with cooked lobster or chopped cooked shrimp. Either will produce similar results -- which in any case will be good, and very, very quick.</p>
        <p>Pea and Crab Salad  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>Salt and ground black pepper  11/2 cups shelled fresh peas (or use frozen)  1 medium onion, preferably white, finely chopped  1/2 red or yellow bell pepper, or a combination, minced  6 to 8 ounces fresh cooked crabmeat  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or to taste  Freshly squeezed lemon juice to taste  4 iceberg lettuce leaves or 16 endive leaves, washed and dried, optional  Shredded basil or chopped parsley leaves for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and salt it. Poach peas in water until bright green, about 30 seconds, and remove with a slotted spoon; drain and cool for a few minutes. If you would like a milder flavor, poach onions for 15 seconds, and remove with a slotted spoon; drain and cool for a few minutes.  2. In a bowl, combine peas, onion, bell pepper, crab, olive oil, lemon juice and some salt and pepper; taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. To serve, spoon into lettuce cups or on top of endive leaves; garnish and serve.  Yield: 4 or more servings.</p>
