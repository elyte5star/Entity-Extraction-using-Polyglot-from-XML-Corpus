        <p>Inflation in China reached a 27-month high of 3.4 percent in May, government statisticians announced yesterday, but the increase in consumer prices was heavily concentrated in food, while figures for growth in the money supply and in loans suggested that the broader economy was not yet overheating.</p>
        <p>The central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, warned on June 5 that the government might have to take action if inflation moved above the bank's target of 3 percent, the level reached in April.</p>
        <p>Investment bank economists said higher interest rates were needed to ensure that bank deposits remained attractive as an alternative to the highly speculative stock markets; the benchmark Shanghai composite index rose yesterday for the fifth consecutive trading day. But the economists doubted that officials would soon resort to the kind of emergency measures they invoked when inflation briefly quintupled in 2004, to 5.3 percent.</p>
        <p>''All anticipated tightening measures should still be moderate as there is no need for Beijing to slam on brakes,'' wrote Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC, in a research note.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials have watched data on the money supply and credit growth for indications whether monetary policy is too tight or too loose. Figures released yesterday showed that year-over-year growth in the M2, a fairly broad measure of the money supply, slowed to 16.7 percent in May from 17.1 percent in April, while year-over-year growth in loans was unchanged at 16 percent in both months.</p>
        <p>Both rates were high, though not accelerating, because money is pouring into China in foreign investment and through an ever-widening trade surplus. ''The slowdown in money and credit for this month may not last long going forward,'' a Goldman Sachs economist, Hong Liang, wrote in a research note.</p>
        <p>Food prices were 8.3 percent higher in May than a year earlier, led by meat and poultry prices, up 26.5 percent, and egg prices, up 37.1 percent. Higher grain prices have increased the cost of feeding livestock. But clothing prices fell by 0.1 percent.</p>
