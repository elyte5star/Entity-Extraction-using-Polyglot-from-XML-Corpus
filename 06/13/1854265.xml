        <p>Ten days after four men were accused of plotting to destroy fuel lines at Kennedy International Airport, state legislators have introduced a bill that would allow the enforcement of more stringent security measures at similar pipelines across the state. The legislation -- sponsored by Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat, and Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Rockville Centre Republican -- calls for officials to review security at private pipelines that carry jet fuel and to make recommendations for improvements by the end of 2008. The state could then require companies to enact additional safeguards based on the recommendations. Roy Haase, a spokesman for Buckeye Partners, the Pennsylvania company that operates the tanks at Kennedy, said Buckeye employees ''patrol every foot of the pipeline at least once per week.''</p>
