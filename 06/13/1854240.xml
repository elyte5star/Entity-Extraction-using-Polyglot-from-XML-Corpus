        <p>Jazz at Lincoln Center will have a new executive director as of Oct. 1, the company announced on Monday. Adrian Ellis, president of AEA Consulting, will replace Katherine Brown, who is resigning after a decade with the organization. Mr. Ellis will be primarily responsible for operational and financial matters. Wynton Marsalis is the company's artistic director. At AEA, a management consulting company with offices in New York and London, Mr. Ellis has served clients like the National Gallery in London, San Francisco Opera, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Frick Collection. In April 2006, Derek E. Gordon stepped down as president and chief executive of Jazz at Lincoln Center after a little more than a year in the job.</p>
