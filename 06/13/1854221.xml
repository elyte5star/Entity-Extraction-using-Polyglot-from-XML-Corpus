        <p>It wasn't too long ago that the sleek and expansive test kitchens at ConAgra Foods were little more than decoration.</p>
        <p>Built from dozens of acquisitions, ConAgra owned a dizzying variety of familiar names -- Slim Jim, Hunt's, Reddi-wip and Manwich, among others -- but it was not dishing up new products. Its brands operated independently and often struggled to keep up with their competitors.</p>
        <p>''Everyone was consolidating except for us,'' said Gary M. Rodkin, who took over as chief executive in autumn 2005. ''I knew I was coming into a massive turnaround.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Rodkin, a slim and energetic 55-year-old who bears some resemblance to Peter Sellers, shoveled in a Healthy Choice panini sandwich and gave his corporate chefs a satisfied nod. Having spent the last 20 months cutting a bloated bureaucracy, he had invited two dozen Wall Street analysts to ConAgra's headquarters here to show off the first new products under his tenure.</p>
        <p>Besides the panini sandwiches, Mr. Rodkin rolled out Healthy Choice dinners that do not get mushy when microwaved because the sauce is cooked in a separate container, Orville Redenbacher popcorn that is low in sodium but retains a salty taste, and Chef Boyardee microwave-ready macaroni and cheese that does not require the addition of water or cheese powder.</p>
        <p>''Versus old ConAgra? This is as different as you can possibly imagine,'' Mr. Rodkin said. ''Literally, the cupboard was bare 18 months ago.''</p>
        <p>None of the products he introduced were entirely new brands, but rather updated twists on the company's old portfolio. For instance, ConAgra will introduce Pam Professional cooking oil this summer for enthusiasts who cook with high heat. The ergonomically correct silver canister goes well with stainless-steel kitchen appliances, ConAgra officials said.</p>
        <p>The company, which had $11.6 billion in net sales last year, is hardly setting Wall Street ablaze with its financial performance, and many remain skeptical that Mr. Rodkin can revive a business with so many second- and third-tier brands that struggle to retain shelf space in grocery aisles. Even its top sellers, like Healthy Choice and Orville Redenbacher, are in slow-growing categories.</p>
        <p>Still, industry analysts credit Mr. Rodkin with steering ConAgra in the right direction after years of drift. Arriving from PepsiCo, where his last job was as head of the North American business, Mr. Rodkin's first moves at ConAgra included finding $100 million in cost savings, which included closing nine manufacturing plants, and replacing nearly the entire senior management.</p>
        <p>And that may have been the easier part. Now Mr. Rodkin faces the task of finding ways to please increasingly fickle consumers.</p>
        <p>In a May 30 note to investors, Greggory Warren, an analyst at Morningstar, wrote: ''While we were critics at first, we have to admit that the company has done a fantastic job over the past year of picking a lot of the low-hanging fruit that was there for the taking. The longer-term key, though, is for the firm to demonstrate that it can really nurture growth in its disparate portfolio of brands and product lines.''</p>
        <p>ConAgra shares many of the problems of other packaged-food companies, including Kraft Foods, Unilever and General Mills. Many consumers no longer buy their food at traditional supermarkets, but now also shop for groceries at places like Wal-Mart, Costco and Trader Joe's. The growing choice of stores has brought more product options, giving shoppers far more choices than the traditional brand-name processed foods.</p>
        <p>They are also buying more private-label products because the quality has vastly improved, more ready-to-eat foods because of their convenience, and more natural and organic fare out of health concerns. Those trends alone work against ConAgra, which is selling Swiss Miss hot chocolate mix, Wesson oil and Van Camp's canned pork and beans in an age when more people are reaching for bagged salad greens and vitamin-infused water.</p>
        <p>But the company's problems extend beyond the appeal of its brands. It has underperformed competitors, missed earnings targets and suffered a series of accounting problems that forced it to restate earnings in some recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodkin, a native of New Jersey who rose through the ranks at General Mills and PepsiCo, was considered a big catch for ConAgra, and was guaranteed a $2 million cash bonus in his first year on the job (in addition to more than $2 million in consulting fees from Pepsi).</p>
        <p>His strategy has focused on operating ConAgra as one company instead of different fiefs, which reduced expenses and allowed for a sharing of ideas among brands. ConAgra's Missouri River campus is now plastered with banners that read, ''One company growing by nourishing lives and finding a better way today  one bite at a time.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Rodkin directed $75 million more in advertising this fiscal year -- a total of $410 million -- and promised to focus on the top-performing brands.</p>
        <p>His turnaround plan suffered a setback in February when salmonella in Peter Pan peanut butter made at least 425 people sick. Still, quarterly earnings in March showed some signs of progress, despite the costs of the peanut butter recall. Sales were up 2 percent, to $2.92 billion, and the company posted a profit of $193 million. A year earlier, in contrast, it reported a $25 million loss. Mr. Rodkin says his goal is 2 to 3 percent annual sales growth in the next three years, as well as 8 to 10 percent yearly growth in earnings per share.</p>
        <p>So far, his efforts have done little to budge the stock price. Shares of ConAgra closed on Tuesday at $25.44; the stock price was $24.74 when Mr. Rodkin took over in 2005.</p>
        <p>Christopher R. Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said in a note to investors last Wednesday that the company's focus on its top brands had been disappointing to date. ''Our primary concern with ConAgra remains that it competes in slower-growing categories and that its position in many categories remains less than advantageous. Product innovation will be needed to further boost results.''</p>
        <p>Harvey Hartman, chief executive of the Hartman Group, a food consulting and market research firm, said ConAgra remained too focused on ''industrial food'' that did not reflect changing tastes. ''We believe that the legacy brands are spiraling downhill,'' he said. ''We question if very few of those things can survive long term.''</p>
        <p>But David Driscoll of Citigroup is bullish on ConAgra's future and gives Mr. Rodkin credit for ''a turnaround story.''</p>
        <p>''We came away impressed with the firm's new product pipeline,'' Mr. Driscoll said in a note to investors after attending the meeting here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodkin said ConAgra needed a stronger talent pool, more efficient operations and new products that spurred growth. He plans to introduce products every six months or so. ''We are not going to win a prize for quantity,'' he said. ''We are going to win a prize for batting average.''</p>
