        <p>American-led forces killed seven Afghan policemen and wounded five more in an exchange of fire early Tuesday that Afghan police officials said was a result of mistaken identity.</p>
        <p>At an Afghan police checkpoint in the Khogyani district, in the eastern province of Nangarhar, Afghan and American forces mistook each other for insurgent fighters and opened fire. During the exchange, the Americans called in air support.</p>
        <p>''The American troops were coming toward the Afghan police post as both sides did not know the identity of each other,'' said Nasir Ahmad Safi, an Afghan police official in Nangarhar. He said the bodies of the policemen were riddled with bullets.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the American forces said that they were en route to an operation at a Taliban house in the Shirzad district of Nangarhar Province on Monday night when they were ambushed and attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire.</p>
        <p>The Americans returned fire and called in air support, said the spokesman, Maj. Chris Belcher.</p>
        <p>Afghan authorities regularly complain of a lack of coordination between the American-led forces and Afghan forces, saying many civilian casualties have resulted.</p>
        <p>The Afghan police in Nangarhar said they were not aware of any operation by American-led troops on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the American forces said they had killed more than two dozen enemy fighters during an eight-hour battle on Monday in the southern province of Kandahar. The battle began when American and Afghan forces were attacked by more than 30 fighters, a statement from the American military said.</p>
        <p>The police said two students, ages 29 and 15, were killed and four were wounded outside a girls' school in the southeastern province of Logar on Tuesday when two gunmen opened fire on students as they left for home. The police were searching for the gunmen, who fled.</p>
        <p>The provincial police chief, Ghulam Mustafa, blamed Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters for the attack in Sayed Habibullah village, south of the capital, Kabul.</p>
        <p>When the Taliban were in power, women and girls were barred from attending school.</p>
