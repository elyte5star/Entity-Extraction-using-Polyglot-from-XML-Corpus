        <p>Harold Reynolds went to work yesterday as an analyst for MLB.com, almost 11 months after being fired by ESPN in a disputed sexual-harassment case. He is suing ESPN for wrongful termination and damages.</p>
        <p>Reynolds, 46, will work intermittently for MLB.com until the All-Star Game, after which he will have a 15-minute afternoon program Mondays through Fridays.</p>
        <p>''I think this is just the beginning,'' he said by telephone after his one-hour debut, in which he took questions from fans.</p>
        <p>Reynolds said he had had early talks about joining the MLB Channel when it starts operations in 2009, but that is not part of his contract.</p>
        <p>The months since his dismissal by ESPN have been difficult, he said, ''but I've got a tremendous wife who's shown great strength through this.''</p>
        <p>ESPN fired him four months into a six-year contract that was to pay him at least $4.9 million; it later said in a state court filing that five young women had lodged ''concerns'' about Reynolds's sexual misconduct.</p>
        <p>Last month, a judge in Hartford ordered ESPN to give Reynolds his personnel file; the contents, he said, ''made my case stronger.''</p>
        <p>''It had what they claimed was in there,'' he said, referring to ESPN officials, ''but for the first time I saw what they were going on, and I felt like their stories were misrepresented. It's kind of sad.''</p>
        <p>Reynolds said ESPN executives never asked him about the accusations before he was dismissed after 11 years at the network. He was an analyst on ''Baseball Tonight.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''This isn't about flowers, gifts, cards, lewd jokes, not any of that stuff, because that's not my behavior,'' but a misunderstanding over buying a meal for a woman who was an intern.</p>
        <p>Reynolds began to talk to baseball officials this year. In a meeting with Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, he said, ''I was totally open and transparent and assured him that I didn't feel like I had done anything wrong and that I won't embarrass you.''</p>
        <p>Reynolds then met with Bob Bowman, the president of MLB Advanced Media, which owns MLB.com.</p>
        <p>''Harold has a great reputation as a baseball analyst, and we felt comfortable with that,'' Bowman said. ''We asked about his situation, he addressed our questions and we were satisfied.''</p>
        <p>Reynolds, a former Seattle Mariners second baseman, said he had been spending much of his time with his 13-month-old daughter, his first child.</p>
        <p>He said he also had been discussing baseball with a group of older men over coffee at a deli near his home in West Hartford, Conn.</p>
        <p>''They've kept me sharp,'' he said.</p>
