        <p>''P.S. I Loved You,'' by Aimee Mann (Op-Ed, June 3), shares an interesting perspective on why she cannot bear listening to ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' as an adult musician: She fears it's not the achievement it seemed when she was a youth, surpassed by the better melodies and lyrics of others.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''P.S. I Loved You,'' by Aimee Mann (Op-Ed, June 3), shares an interesting perspective on why she cannot bear listening to ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' as an adult musician: She fears it's not the achievement it seemed when she was a youth, surpassed by the better melodies and lyrics of others.</p>
        <p>All in all, she says, it is ''like realizing you can beat your own father at chess or arm-wrestling.'' And that's a downer. But in this case, Dad is a bit more than a chess dilettante; he's the one who tore up the rulebook and rewrote it for generations to come.</p>
        <p>Sure, others have been able to take popular music to new heights or have achieved greater depth -- maybe Ms. Mann among them. But they are building on a foundation that the Beatles, more than anyone else, helped establish.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Ms. Mann will write her next Op-Ed essay after she's recorded something as utterly revolutionary or influential as ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' ''Revolver'' or ''Abbey Road.''</p>
