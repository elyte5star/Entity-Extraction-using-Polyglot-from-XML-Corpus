        <p>Despite the recent spate of takeovers in the beleaguered newspaper industry, analysts are skeptical that many more will follow.</p>

        <p>The McClatchy Company bought Knight Ridder and then sold pieces of it, the Tribune Company took itself private under a plan devised by the real estate developer Samuel Zell, and Rupert Murdoch has mounted a strong run at Dow Jones &amp; Company-- all in the last year.</p>
        <p>So who might be next?</p>
        <p>Struggling with shrinking margins and uncertain prospects, newspaper companies have endured slumps in their stock prices in the past four years, making them ripe takeover targets. But bankers and analysts are skeptical that the takeover bids will continue up the food chain -- with the caveat that there is the occasional, mercurial billionaire who might be interested and can make a rich enough offer to tempt all but the most determined owners.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you can draw a lot of parallels between the ones that have sold, or look like they're about to sell, and the ones that haven't,'' said Barry L. Lucas, senior vice president for research at Gabelli &amp; Company, an investment firm.</p>
        <p>Most of the nation's big newspaper companies are family-controlled and have dual-class share structures intended to keep them that way -- The New York Times Company, the Washington Post Company, the McClatchy Company, E. W. Scripps and others. And in each case, experts say, the family appears to have greater solidarity and commitment to maintain control than do the Bancrofts, the owners of a controlling interest in Dow Jones.</p>
        <p>A few other major players in the industry, like the Hearst Corporation and the MediaNews Group, are privately held.</p>
        <p>''Knight Ridder had a single class of stock, and so did Tribune, though it had some very big owners,'' Mr. Lucas said. ''And Dow Jones has a family that has some real dissatisfaction and isn't involved in running the company.''</p>
        <p>That leaves the Gannett Company, which publishes 90 daily newspapers, including USA Today, as perhaps the most tempting target, people who follow the industry say. It is the largest and most profitable newspaper company in the nation, with a single class of shares and no controlling family. And despite its strong financial performance, Gannett's stock is trading at less than 12 times its projected 2007 earnings; most major newspaper companies are at 16 to 17.</p>
        <p>Even so, a serious bid for Gannett, which has market capitalization of $13.62 billion, is seen as unlikely.</p>
        <p>''Gannett is so big that I just don't see anybody else in the business swallowing them,'' said John Morton, an industry analyst. ''You'd have to be talking about somebody really big, beyond print media -- private equity, General Electric -- and I haven't heard of anybody like that being interested. I'd be somewhat surprised to see any more big deals for newspaper companies.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Morton said, despite its depressed stock price, Gannett has not experienced the kind of shareholder discontent that troubled Knight Ridder, and has been voiced at The New York Times Company.</p>
        <p>If not for its dual-class stock structure, the Times Company would be the likeliest newspaper takeover target, analysts said. It has a storied name and disgruntled outside shareholders, and it has largely abstained from the newsroom trimming most newspapers have done, a stance seen by investors as proof that there is room to cut costs.</p>
        <p>The Times Company, which publishes The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The International Herald Tribune and some smaller papers, declined to comment for this article, but the chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., has said repeatedly that his family has no interest in yielding control.</p>
        <p>A contingent of investors led by Hassan Elmasry of Morgan Stanley Investment Management has criticized the management and performance of the Times Company, and in April they withheld 42 percent of the Class A shareholder vote in the election of directors.</p>
        <p>But the Class B shares have the power to elect 9 of the company's 13 board members, and the Sulzberger family controls 89 percent of those shares. The Class A shares elect the other 4 board members, and the family is the largest holder of that stock, with 19 percent.</p>
        <p>''Nothing is going to happen there unless somebody makes a truly stunning offer, or the company stops being profitable and the family starts to get really worried,'' said an investment banker who does media deals and was granted anonymity to discuss potential clients.</p>
        <p>Some newspaper companies -- notably the Washington Post Company and Scripps -- are much less reliant on their newspaper properties. That has helped to keep their stocks from dropping as much as most of their peers, offering another layer of protection against a takeover.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Murdoch succeeds in buying Dow Jones and its centerpiece, The Wall Street Journal, that would change the competitive landscape.</p>
        <p>Many media analysts believe that he wants to get into a circulation fight with The Financial Times, The Journal's much smaller competitor based in England, in part by increasing sales of the European edition of The Journal. That could prompt The Financial Times's owner, Pearson, which is primarily a book publisher, to find a buyer for the paper that is better equipped to compete with Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation.</p>
        <p>But the greater effect would be felt in electronic media. Owning Dow Jones would aid the fortunes of the Fox cable business channel that News Corporation plans to start this year. And some analysts say that News Corporation has the resources to make Dow Jones Newswires a stronger competitor to the newly merged Thomson-Reuters and to Bloomberg News.</p>
