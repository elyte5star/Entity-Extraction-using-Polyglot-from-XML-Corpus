        <p>Paris Hilton Says She's 'Learning and Growing' in Jail</p>
        <p>Paris Hilton has accepted her fate as a jailbird, saying she will not appeal her 45-day sentence and is ''learning and growing'' from her time as an inmate, The Associated Press reported yesterday. In a statement released Saturday by one of her lawyers after a judge countermanded her shift by sheriff's order from jail to house arrest, Ms. Hilton, 26, said, ''While I greatly appreciate the sheriff's concern for my health and welfare, I intend to serve my time at L.A. County Jail.'' She added: ''Being in jail is by far the hardest thing I have ever done. During the past several days, I have had a lot of time to think, and I believe that I am learning and growing from the experience.'' Ms. Hilton described herself as ''shocked'' by the attention her case had received and suggested that the public address itself to ''more important things like the men and women serving our country in Iraq.'' Ms. Hilton's sentence was imposed after she was caught driving with a license suspended from a reckless driving case.</p>
        <p>Bollywood Honors</p>
        <p>Bollywood's version of the Academy Awards was dominated yesterday by ''Rang De Basanti'' (''Paint It Yellow''), a film about a filmmaker who wants to make a movie about Indian nationalists who rebelled against British colonial rule. The film, directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, was nominated for 15 awards and took 10, including best film, at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in Sheffield, England, Agence France-Presse reported. (The awards show shifts locations every year.) The ceremonies, including onstage performances by stars like Shilpa Shetty, right, were watched by a live audience of 12,500 as well as television audience estimated at 500 million in 110 countries.</p>
        <p>You're the Top; You're a Bed and Breakfast</p>
        <p>Night and day from now on, Cole Porter's childhood home is a bed and breakfast and museum. Several hundred fans were on hand Friday to attend the dedication of the two-story wood-frame house where the composer of such standards as ''Night and Day,'' ''Begin the Beguine'' and ''Anything Goes'' was born in 1891, lived his first 10 years and learned to play the piano (and violin). The house, in Peru, Ind., about 65 miles north of Indianapolis, had even been used as a methamphetamine lab before Porter devotees intervened to restore it with financing from the Ole Olsen Memorial Theater, a Peru organization that bought the home in 2004. Porter died in 1964.</p>
        <p>Malian Photographer Honored at Biennale</p>
        <p>The Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, known for works like ''Vues de Does,'' below, became the first African to be awarded the Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale, Agence France-Presse reported. Robert Storr, the show's artistic director, said, ''No African artist has done more to enhance photography's stature in the region, contribute to its history, enrich its image archive or increase our awareness of the textures and transformations of African culture in the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st than Malick Sidibé.''</p>
        <p>Napoleon's Sword Sets Auction Record</p>
        <p>A gold-encrusted saber, above, carried by Napoleon at the Battle of Marengo, in which he drove the Austrian army from Italy on June 14, 1800, fetched $6.4 million yesterday at an auction at Fontainebleau, outside Paris, Agence France-Presse reported. ''It's a world record for a souvenir of the emperor, for a sword and for a weapon in general,'' said Bernard Croissy, a spokesman for the auctioneers, Osenat. The price was about four times the estimate.</p>
        <p>John Lennon's Decision</p>
        <p>On the night of Dec. 8, 1980, John Lennon faced a choice. And his decision to reject a dinner out in favor of a chance to see his little boy, Sean, led to his death, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. ''We were returning from the studio,'' his widow, Yoko Ono, told BBC radio, ''and I said, 'Should we go and have dinner before we go home?' John was saying, 'No, let's go home because I want to see Sean before he goes to sleep.' '' Lennon was killed that night outside his home in Manhattan by Mark David Chapman, who remains in prison.</p>
