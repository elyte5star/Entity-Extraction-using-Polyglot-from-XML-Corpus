        <p>A Brooklyn man was fatally shot shortly after 11 a.m. yesterday in a fight on the street in Bushwick, the authorities said. Acquaintances identified the man as Jose Torres, who they said was in his early 20s. He was pronounced dead at the scene, near the corner of Stanhope Street and Wyckoff Avenue, where, a witness said, he had been shot several times. The witness, who declined to be identified by name, said that Mr. Torres was riding his bicycle when he was approached by the other man. When Mr. Torres got off the bicycle and began fighting, the other man pulled out a gun and fired, the witness said. The police arrested Adrian Aguiliar, 30, of Brooklyn and charged him with murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
