        <p>Adam Cohen (Editorial Observer, June 3) disapproves of Justice Clarence Thomas's jurisprudence, because in Mr. Cohen's view it is indifferent to suffering and ''harsh,'' will make various institutions ''less civilized'' and ''less fair,'' and fails to respond to ''moral truth.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Adam Cohen (Editorial Observer, June 3) disapproves of Justice Clarence Thomas's jurisprudence, because in Mr. Cohen's view it is indifferent to suffering and ''harsh,'' will make various institutions ''less civilized'' and ''less fair,'' and fails to respond to ''moral truth.''</p>
        <p>But a justice's job under our Constitution is not to decree what is civilized or fair or even what is moral truth; it is to follow the law. Justice Thomas believes that the way to follow the law is to follow the text of legal documents, like the Constitution adopted by We the People and the laws passed by the legislators we have elected.</p>
        <p>I suspect that many of Justice Thomas's critics would be horrified if they thought that the Bush administration were ignoring the text of the Constitution or a federal law to advance what it viewed as a higher moral truth. Why do they think that another branch of government should do so?</p>
