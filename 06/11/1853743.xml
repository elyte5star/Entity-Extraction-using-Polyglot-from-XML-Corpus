        <p>For the powers at the Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's pre-eminent talent representative, the coming blockbuster ''Transformers'' has already brought a lesson in the cold-hearted ways of corporate entertainment.</p>
        <p>The outsize robot adventure movie was born when the talent agency connected Hasbro -- a client, and owner of the Transformers toy line -- with DreamWorks, Paramount and another longtime associate, Steven Spielberg, among others. As the project grew, at least 10 Creative Artists clients picked up credits, including the writers, several stars and both Mr. Spielberg and Brian Goldner, Hasbro's chief operating officer, who are executive producers.</p>
        <p>But a scant month before the picture's release on July 4, Hasbro decided to jettison Creative Artists and jump to the rival William Morris, which represents the director of ''Transformers,'' Michael Bay.</p>
        <p>So it goes in the new Hollywood. Loyalty stops at the bottom line, and even the most powerful of agencies is finding it can be tougher to meet the needs of a corporate customer than to baby-sit for a temperamental star.</p>
        <p>Wayne Charness, Hasbro's senior vice president for corporate communications, credited Creative Artists for its ''invaluable assistance'' in hooking it up with DreamWorks and Paramount. ''For that, we'll certainly be eternally grateful.''</p>
        <p>But, in explaining the corporate kiss-off, Mr. Charness added, ''William Morris, from an entertainment point of view, is best able to deliver something for us now.''</p>
        <p>For Creative Artists, the loss of Hasbro is hardly a show-stopper. But the embarrassment comes just as it is trying to prove that it can mirror, if not exactly match, the intricacy and reach of the media conglomerates and consumer and technology companies that have come to define the entertainment world.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the agency has been quietly shifting its center of balance. It is fighting to protect core movie, television and music businesses that are confronted by changing technology and consolidation among buyers, even while adding new divisions that are meant -- if they keep their footing -- to ease the company and its clients toward the uncertain future.</p>
        <p>Nested since January in a new glass-sheathed Century City tower, Creative Artists has doubled in size in the last five years to about 300 agents and executives, and roughly 700 employees over all. In that time, it not only raided competitors for agents and talent in the movie and television businesses, but began representing athletes and added dozens of marketers and licensing operatives who are supposed to keep pace with the likes of Coca-Cola, Delta, eBay and, until lately, Hasbro.</p>
        <p>Whether brokering exclusive entertainment for Delta flights or setting up ''lifestyle'' tours on the skateboard circuit, the agency's new businesses mostly involve transactions between talent or mainstream entertainment companies and a widening ring of customers.</p>
        <p>To outsiders, the logic of that push has not always been clear. Competitors complain privately of what they often see as a simple urge for dominance. And the expansion has created new pressures within the 32-year-old agency, which is scrambling to keep its growing list of more than 2,000 clients employed and happy as it seeks to master new worlds.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, agency watchers have been intrigued by some belt-tightening at Creative Artists, which ordered agents to refrain from extras like first-class plane tickets. That measure, reported by the Deadline Hollywood blog, was widely viewed as a response to the added cost of the new quarters and the need to pay $1-million-plus salaries to agents snatched from William Morris, Endeavor, International Creative Management or the United Talent Agency.</p>
        <p>Yet the agency's basic challenges are no different from those of major competitors, who have been similarly reaching for the next rung, if not always on so grand a scale. And its success or failure is likely to tell whether talents as varied as Will Ferrell, Tom Cruise, Jerry Bruckheimer, Derek Jeter or Norah Jones -- Creative Artists clients all -- will maintain their leverage against evolving media giants like the News Corporation and Viacom or make new fortunes from the nonentertainment companies that are looking to Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Citing a longstanding policy against public discussion of their affairs, the agency's executives declined to comment for this article. Richard Lovett, its president, has joined fellow managing partners Kevin Huvane, Rob Light, Bryan Lourd, Rick Nicita and David O'Connor in maintaining official silence about the company's inner workings since the late 1990s. (A rare public glimpse of ownership came in 2002, when a filing in Mr. Huvane's divorce showed his stake at the time to be 7.9121 percent.) They were only a bit more talkative last decade, as they weathered a storm of agent and client defections in the wake of their 1995 purchase of Creative Artists from its co-founders: Michael S. Ovitz, Ron Meyer and Bill Haber.</p>
        <p>Their adviser in the buyout was the mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer Martin Lipton. He has since helped to engineer a growth strategy meant to give Creative Artists a command over the talent world complete enough that clients, in theory, would find internal support for virtually any interest, while anyone approaching the entertainment business would find dealing with the agency an inevitability.</p>
        <p>(A recent Web video, ''The Wrath of CAAA,'' catches the spirit: It is about a screenwriter whose assignment, mate, apartment, mother and dog are usurped by an all-powerful agency.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lipton's counsel to the partners, he said in a recent e-mail exchange, was ''to follow their instincts and engage in related areas that benefit from the great expertise that they have perfected in their basic business.''</p>
        <p>Creative Artist's new strategy, which superseded Mr. Ovitz's earlier and limited foray into advertising, pushed the notion that corporations, talent and new technology would combine to create growth even as the recording industry faltered, television networks fractured and studios clamped down on costs.</p>
        <p>Some of the initiative's successes have been as obvious as the Coke cups in the hands of the ''American Idol'' judges. In one of its more triumphant gambits, Creative Artists's marketers helped assemble the hit show for the producer and client Simon Fuller by lining up Coca-Cola, another client, as a backer even before the Fox network became involved.</p>
        <p>In other forays, the agency's marketers joined the music department to organize shopping mall concerts promoting Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's Hollister brand, and helped Delta reclaim its image as an upscale air carrier by associating it with ''Project Runway.'' More recently, Creative Artists took on Joost, the Internet entertainment provider, as a client, and connected Mr. Ferrell and his partner Adam McKay with backers from Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, to start FunnyOrDie.com, a comedy site.</p>
        <p>Years ago, after rejecting a possible merger with United Talent as being too complex, Creative Artists instead undertook a buildup in the more traditional areas of Hollywood talent, picking off clients including Mr. Ferrell, Kate Winslet, Matthew McConaughey and Jim Carrey. Once smaller than William Morris and International Creative Management, Creative Artists now counts slightly more film and television clients than either, according to lists culled from Baseline StudioSystems, a data service owned by The New York Times Company. (None of the three agencies disclose exact client counts.)</p>
        <p>At least some evidence indicatesthat less grandiose agencies are occasionally better able to find work for some clients. An assessment by TVtracker.com, for instance, found that during the 2006-7 television season, Endeavor had the most clients at work on broadcast and cable shows, with a total of 737, to the bigger agency's second-ranked 667.</p>
        <p>Yet a talent agency's revenue comes overwhelmingly from its big earners, and Creative Artists has an abundance of those in all of its main businesses, including sports, where a rapid expansion over the last year brought Mr. Jeter from baseball, Peyton Manning from football and the basketball star Allen Iverson, along with about 350 others, into the fold.</p>
        <p>Operatives who represent the agency's huge list are for the most part layered into eight floors of its Gensler-designed headquarters, which is being called ''the building with a hole in it,'' for the 100-foot space between its bridged wings. (Outlying offices have spread to New York; Nashville; Kansas City, Mo.; St. Louis; London; Beijing; Stockholm; and Calgary, Alberta, and Creative Artists has an ownership stake in Shepardson, Stern &amp; Kaminsky, a New York-based marketing company.)</p>
        <p>Interiors veer from the cold pallor of assistants' rows outside the agents' quarters to the day camp warmth of a patio where lowly players in red company T-shirts have been known to hand out treats at a midafternoon ice cream social.</p>
        <p>And the inner sanctum is a vast, high-gloss and ultracorporate conference room.</p>
        <p>Yet the contretemps with Hasbro points to some vulnerabilities that come with being the mightiest talent agency in Hollywood, not the least of them the difficulty of minding what has become a very large store.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Charness of Hasbro, the company initially came to Creative Artists for help in connecting its games and toys with a wide range of promotions. As things fell out, however, it did not always need the agency's guidance in navigating worlds it had mastered on its own. When striking a deal for a mobile phone game based on the ''Transformers'' film, for instance, Glu Mobile dealt directly with the toymaker, without relying on Creative Artists's gaming expertise. ''We had a longstanding relationship,'' said Jill Braff, Glu Mobile's general manager of the Americas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bay's agents at William Morris, meanwhile, detected Hasbro's hunger for more movies. So they began shaking down clients -- the agency term of art is ''packaging within'' -- for ideas that are likely to surface as half a dozen projects for the toy company in the next couple of months.</p>
        <p>In short, Hasbro wanted to go Hollywood. And Creative Artists, apparently, had become too busy -- or too fancy -- to make that happen. ''We're moving to William Morris as an entertainment client,'' Mr. Charness said.</p>
