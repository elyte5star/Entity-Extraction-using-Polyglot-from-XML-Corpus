        <p>Victor M. De Leon III, a 9-year-old Long Island boy believed to be the world's youngest professional video game player, finished out of the prize money in his latest tournament, the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit Event, which ended yesterday at the Meadowlands in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Victor, a third grader from Holbrook known on the gaming circuit as Lil' Poison, started playing in tournaments when he was 4, staking his claim as the youngest contestant in such events. He now has a corporate sponsorship worth about $20,000 a year, plus trip expenses to compete in tournaments.</p>
        <p>In the three-day event, Victor beat 745 older players in the Halo 2 game individual competition and was ranked 255th.</p>
        <p>The winner of the $2,000 first-place prize was Justin Deese, a teenager from Columbia, S.C., a league spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>Victor also entered the Halo 2 team competition, joining three older players under the name Young Guns, and placed 96th out of 192 teams. The top team, Final Boss, won a $20,000 first-place prize.</p>
        <p>The three-day tournament, part of a national tour, drew about 15,000 spectators, the league said, adding that 40,000 others watched an online telecast.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best-known video gamer, Jonathan Wendel, known as Fatal1ty, said in an e-mail interview that Victor has ''gotten a lot of exposure at a young age and should have a lot of opportunities,'' if he chooses a full-time gaming career and hones his skills as he matures.</p>
        <p>When Victor is ready to advance, Mr. Wendel said, it ''would be great to give him some more pointers to help him go to the next level.'' But Mr. Wendel encouraged young players like Victor, who also enjoys sports and music, to be ''well-rounded'' in their hobbies and activities.</p>
