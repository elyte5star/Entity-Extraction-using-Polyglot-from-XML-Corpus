        <p>At the moment Jeff Gordon won his fourth Nextel Cup race of the season Sunday night, his blue Chevrolet was covered with a rain-spattered tarpaulin and was parked on pit road, 235 miles from the scheduled finish.</p>
        <p>Persistent rain and gathering darkness forced Nascar officials to end the Pocono 500 after only 106 of 200 laps, giving the victory to Gordon and causing thousands of fans, many wearing bright ponchos, to cheer or boo the result.</p>
        <p>Gordon, who stretched his lead in the Nextel Cup standings to 242 points, has always been a lightning rod, despised by as many fans as adore him. The 79th victory of his career came after a rumble of thunder and a stunning stroke of luck.</p>
        <p>Gordon won because his crew chief, Steve Letarte, took a gamble on rain ending the race soon after 101 laps had been completed, or when the race became official. It was the first of 14 Nextel Cup races this season that did not go the scheduled distance.</p>
        <p>''Everybody had the same opportunity to make that same call,'' Gordon said. ''Yes, we were fortunate and lucky when the rain came. But we're having a heck of a year.''</p>
        <p>When Ryan Newman and others made pit stops after the 64th lap of a race that had been delayed three hours by rain, Gordon stayed on the track and took the lead. He made a pit stop after the 81st lap for enough fuel to complete 101 laps.</p>
        <p>Newman, who won the pole position for the race Friday, had to pit again after 90 laps, ceding the lead to Denny Hamlin, who had led 44 of the first 50 laps. But Hamlin, then Carl Edwards, gave up the lead because they also needed to make pit stops.</p>
        <p>Gordon took the lead on the 98th lap and held it until rain pelted the racetrack, leading to the fourth caution of the race. The race was later red-flagged, forcing the drivers to park on pit road for about a half-hour.</p>
        <p>Trucks with high-pitched jet dryers took to the track in an attempt to make conditions favorable for a restart. The sky to the west of the track was sunny, but inky rain clouds hovered over the track, sprinkling Turn 1 with rain.</p>
        <p>Much to the displeasure of a portion of the crowd that had waited out a long day, the race was not resumed. Four of Gordon's 79 victories in Nascar's top series have come in rain-shortened races.</p>
        <p>''The 24 snookered all of us pretty bad,'' Martin Truex Jr., who finished third, said, referring to Gordon by his car number. ''But I think with five or 10 more laps, we would have had a shot at the win,''</p>
        <p>Still, Gordon nearly lost the race just before it was stopped. As he closed on Tony Raines's car on a portion of the racetrack that had begun to be pelted by rain, Gordon suddenly slowed, allowing Newman to make one last charge at him.</p>
        <p>Nascar officials called the final caution period with Gordon's car only about four feet ahead of Newman's blue Dodge near the second turn. By that point, Gordon said, he was screaming into his radio, calling for officials to stop the race.</p>
        <p>''If you only knew how excited I was,'' Gordon said.</p>
        <p>Newman, who has not won a race in what has been a disappointing season, tartly called the race the ''Pocono 101,'' but he declined to call Gordon's victory controversial.</p>
        <p>''They played that card,'' Newman said, referring to Letarte's strategy, ''but they were in a position to play that card, and we weren't in that position.''</p>
        <p>Letarte said that he was simply trying to come up with a plan to get Gordon's car to the front of the pack, where it ran better in clean air. But Gordon said that Letarte also seemed to be focused on the weather radar screens in his pit box.</p>
        <p>When Letarte was told that television commentators had second-guessed his decision to keep Gordon on the racetrack at Lap 65, he smiled and said, ''I guess it was incredibly stupid, but sometimes stupid works.''</p>
        <p>Matt Kenseth, who finished ninth, replaced Jimmie Johnson in second place in the standings. Johnson, who fell to fourth in the standings, finished 42nd after his left front tire blew out, showering the track with sparks as he returned to the pits.</p>
        <p>Gordon encountered no such misfortune. It is turning into a wonderful year. In addition to his four victories, he has 12 top-10 finishes. Also, his wife, Ingrid Vandebosch, is due to have the couple's first child later this month.</p>
        <p>After Gordon learned that he had won the race, he said: ''I can't believe it. We just won this race. Wow. Wow. I don't know what to say.''</p>
        <p>Then, after a pause, he added, ''Hi, baby.''</p>
