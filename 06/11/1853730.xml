        <p>Many devotees of Benjamin Britten feel that his final opera, ''Death in Venice,'' based on the Thomas Mann novella and first presented at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1973, is a profound, piercing and inexplicably neglected masterpiece. At the moment, though, the opera seems anything but neglected, at least in Britten's native land. The Aldeburgh Festival, which Britten helped found, is presenting a grippingly austere production of the opera, its first staging here in nearly 30 years. The first performance, on Friday night, provided a momentous opening for this renowned festival's 60th anniversary.</p>
        <p>In London, meanwhile, the English National Opera is also presenting a production of ''Death in Venice,'' its first, which opened May 24. The elaborate and brilliant staging by the director Deborah Warner offers the British tenor Ian Bostridge in the demanding lead role of Gustav von Aschenbach.

        <p>Many devotees of Benjamin Britten feel that his final opera, ''Death in Venice,'' based on the Thomas Mann novella and first presented at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1973, is a profound, piercing and inexplicably neglected masterpiece. At the moment, though, the opera seems anything but neglected, at least in Britten's native land. The Aldeburgh Festival, which Britten helped found, is presenting a grippingly austere production of the opera, its first staging here in nearly 30 years. The first performance, on Friday night, provided a momentous opening for this renowned festival's 60th anniversary.</p>
        <p>In London, meanwhile, the English National Opera is also presenting a production of ''Death in Venice,'' its first, which opened May 24. The elaborate and brilliant staging by the director Deborah Warner offers the British tenor Ian Bostridge in the demanding lead role of Gustav von Aschenbach. I attended the performance on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>John Berry, the artistic director of the English National Opera, says the appearance of these simultaneous productions is just a coincidence. Jonathan Reekie, the chief executive of Aldeburgh, says that the matter is ''more complicated.'' He wanted to present ''Death in Venice'' at Aldeburgh for years and approached the English National Opera with the prospect of a co-production. But during the last decade that company went through tumultuous times, with administrative turnovers, deficits, labor disputes and canceled performances. So it was hard to elicit a commitment, Mr. Reekie said. The overlap may be curious, but the winners are Britten, ''Death in Venice'' and lucky audiences.</p>
        <p>Some criticism of the opera has come from champions of Mann's 1912 novella, which tells of an eminent German author who, suffering from a debilitating creative block, travels to Venice, where he becomes enthralled from a safe distance with Tadzio, a boy in an aristocratic Polish family on vacation. Aschenbach's feelings turn into an obsession. Succumbing to a cholera outbreak, Aschenbach dies while sitting in a beach chair and watching his angelic Tadzio wander off mystically into the sea. Or so he thinks.</p>
        <p>With a libretto by Myfanwy Piper, the opera does simplify Mann's elaborate and philosophical story. By making dancers of Tadzio and his playmates on the beach, Britten found a stage-worthy way to depict the spell the boy casts on Aschenbach. Mann's Tadzio, while enchantingly beautiful, is imperfect, with jagged, pale teeth and an anemic look. In Britten's operatic telling, the music, rich with complexity, regret and ambiguity, powerfully conveys the vulnerability of the ascetic and intellectual Aschenbach as he is overcome by the vision of a beautiful boy, causing him to question every choice he has made and the worth of his art. This is something Britten understood; though devoted to his life partner, the tenor Peter Pears, he was continually smitten with boys and young men.</p>
        <p>There are ingenious strokes in this engrossing score. Though somewhat reduced, the orchestra is enriched with a battery of percussion evoking Balinese gamelan music, which Britten uses effectively to convey the Dionysian cavorting of the boys on the beach. Atonal and 12-tone music, which depicts Aschenbach enmeshed in the intellectual world, is contrasted with hauntingly sensual diatonic sonorities to suggest idealized youth. Aschenbach sings extended passages of minimally accompanied and devastatingly poignant monologue.</p>
        <p>These productions enhanced my respect for the opera's dramatic intensity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Warner's staging uses handsome period costumes colored mostly in black, white and brown. The story opens in a graveyard and continually shifts scenes: a boat to Venice, the bank of the Lido, the canals of the city, various rooms and salons in the hotel, the beach. All are conjured here through fluid movements of curtains, walls, furniture, a steamship smokestack, dropped cloths and rope nets. The sunlight on the beach is sometimes so glaring that you almost feel the humidity.</p>
        <p>Edward Gardner, a dynamic 32-year-old conductor in his first assignment as the company's music director, delivered a nuanced and incisive performance. Besides Aschenbach, the other major role is a tour de force for a baritone, who portrays seven characters, including a traveler, an elderly fop, an old gondolier and the hotel barber: slyly Mephistophelean figures who entice Aschenbach to follow his desires. Peter Coleman-Wright was commanding in those roles.</p>
        <p>Kim Brandstrup provided sensually athletic choreography for the dancers, and Benjamin Paul Griffiths was boyish and perfect as Tadzio, sweet-faced yet slightly flirtatious as the character realizes, on some level, the allure he has for a strange man.</p>
        <p>But the production is dominated by Mr. Bostridge. Although some have found him, at 42, too young for the role, Mann's notes suggest that he thought of the character as about 53, and Mr. Bostridge, his back bent with perplexity, gives a courageous performance. At one point he thrashes about the stage floor in a dream scene when, tempted by Dionysus, he experiences erotic feelings for Tadzio.</p>
        <p>The music suits the myriad qualities of Mr. Bostridge's unusual voice: spectral yet warm, virile yet boyish, and, when need be, raging and intense. Mr. Bostridge's English diction was a model of clarity, with every word a living presence.</p>
        <p>At Aldeburgh it was meaningful to experience this opera in the space for which it was conceived, Snape Maltings Concert Hall. This large brick building in the neighboring town of Snape was originally a mill house for the brewing of beer. But Britten and Pears turned it into an acoustically lively and intimate 840-seat hall suitable for concerts and opera, which opened in 1967. In the ceiling you still see the square vents through which foamy white steam was emitted during malting time.</p>
        <p>But with no proscenium or backstage area to speak of, productions must be simple. This one, by the director Yoshi Oida, made simplicity a virtue. The set was just movable platforms atop a shallow pool of real water. Many images were stunning, as during the dream scene, when dancers lighted the stage with hand-held torches and surrounded the agonized Aschenbach.</p>
        <p>The tenor Alan Oke gave an honorable, plaintive and volatile portrayal of Aschenbach. Peter Sidhom was arresting in the multiple baritone roles. Pavel Povraznik, a beautiful young dancer from the Tanztheater Nürnberg, made an intriguingly cagey Tadzio.</p>
        <p>And it was inspiring to hear this challenging score played with such accomplishment by the Britten-Pears Orchestra, whose members come from Aldeburgh's young artist training program. In another coincidence the excellent conductor was Paul Daniel, well known as the former music director of the English National Opera, a post he quit two years ago.</p>
        <p>On Saturday morning I actually found myself thinking, ''Well, no 'Death in Venice' today,'' and feeling a little wistful.</p>
