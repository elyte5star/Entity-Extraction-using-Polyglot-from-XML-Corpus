        <p>On Bath Avenue, in a part of Brooklyn once dominated by gangsters and wiseguys, times have changed.</p>
        <p>The music that blared from car stereos on Saturday afternoon was not Sinatra, but the rapper Fat Joe. The accents were not just Italian, but Mexican and Russian. Women wearing Muslim headscarves pushed strollers past front-yard statues of Jesus. And the only social club attracting attention was the truly social one at No. 1635, the Brooklyn Gymnastic Center.</p>
        <p>Last week, the past of Bath Beach and Bensonhurst burst into the present with what the police described as two mob-related shootings. On Tuesday, Robert DeCicco, 56, whose father is a high-ranking member of the Gambino crime family and who was indicted along with his father and 11 others on federal racketeering and extortion charges in January, was shot while sitting in his parked car on Bath Avenue. He survived.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Rudolph Izzi, 74, who the authorities said had been a soldier with the Genovese crime family, was found shot to death in his Shore Parkway home, about a mile and a half from where Mr. DeCicco was shot.</p>
        <p>The police have made no arrests in either case and were trying to determine if the attacks were related.</p>
        <p>The shootings in this patch of southwest Brooklyn were a reminder that though the mob's ways had remained the same, its old neighborhoods had not. In the 62nd Precinct, where the two shootings occurred, there were just four homicides in all of last year.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had anything like this in years,'' City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., whose district includes Bath Avenue, said in reference to last week's shootings. ''This is an isolated situation, and the police are right on top of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Izzi was a throwback, a loan shark who once offered to pay his lawyer with a case of Cutty Sark, according to the lawyer, Arthur L. Aidala, who represented Mr. Izzi in a 2001 case. A few doors from where he lived, an Asian woman filled up a kiddie pool in her driveway and knew nothing of mob hits and Cutty Sark. Another Asian neighbor, barbecue tongs in hand, said he was not worried about getting caught in a Mafia war. ''This is New York, so things can happen,'' said the man, who did not want to give his name.</p>
        <p>But some newcomers to Bath Beach and Bensonhurst, even those unaware of the area's history as a mob stronghold, have learned the old habits: You don't talk about what may or may not be mob activity, and you certainly don't talk, to a reporter at least, about what you may or may not think about two recent shootings.</p>
        <p>''Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies,'' said an elderly woman at Nick's Discount Store on Bath Avenue, where Mr. DeCicco had stopped shortly before he was shot.</p>
        <p>In explaining some residents' unease about commenting, one merchant said, ''It's a touchy situation.''</p>
        <p>Bath Avenue was once the land of the touchy situation.</p>
        <p>It was once the headquarters of Anthony Spero, a high-ranking member of the Bonanno crime family convicted in 2001 of ordering three murders. He used to hold meetings among his rooftop pigeon coops.</p>
        <p>Over the decades, mob figures and their families lived there. Late one September afternoon in 1987, two men associated with the Colombo crime family were shot outside a Bath Avenue dry cleaners. In 1991, Bartholomew Borriello -- the personal driver of John J. Gotti, the Gambino crime family boss -- was gunned down in the driveway of his three-story frame house at 91 Bay 29th Street, less than a mile from where Mr. Izzi lived and died.</p>
        <p>Most recently, in March 2000, three officers and a sergeant from the 62nd Precinct were charged with fixing traffic tickets and checking license plates for the owner of a Bath Avenue social club that the police said was tied to organized crime.</p>
        <p>That club, Cafe Caserta, is now an orthopedic shoe store.</p>
        <p>Indeed, along Bath Avenue these days, it is nearly impossible to find any trace of its mob past. On Saturday, children played outside the Muslim Youth Center. A sign advertised luxury condos. A young man chatted with a neighbor, a cup of coffee in his hand, a sleek P.D.A. on his hip. ''Somebody graffitied the gate,'' said the young man, a 24-year-old waiter and aspiring music producer who gave his name as Eddie M. ''That's usually the most that happens here.''</p>
        <p>Bath Avenue is a wide, quiet strip of shops and small businesses, a few blocks from the Belt Parkway and Gravesend Bay. It is a milk-crate kind of place: People set them out on the sidewalk and sit and watch the Brooklyn pageant. Late Saturday afternoon, men and women in sashes marched down the avenue to the beat of drummers and horns, in honor of St. Anthony.</p>
        <p>Ralph Ventra, 55, who ate a sausage sandwich outside an Italian deli, said this was a peaceful, family-oriented neighborhood. He said the Mafia did not have a real presence but rather a wisp of one. ''It's not overpowering,'' said Mr. Ventra, who lives in nearby Bay Ridge and owns a moving company. ''It's not like the Bloods and the Crips or anything like that. It's not like 'Bronx Tale,' the movie. Those days are over.''</p>
