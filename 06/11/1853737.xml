        <p>Amp'd Mobile's filing for protection from bankruptcy on June 1 may have one unexpected side effect: a delay in the introduction of sex-oriented programming on cellphones.</p>
        <p>No mobile carrier, including Amp'd Mobile, a niche carrier that markets itself as a service for the young and technologically sophisticated, directly offers sexually oriented videos or still nude imagery. Amp'd Mobile let subscribers download pictures of fully clothed pornography stars and models.</p>
        <p>But Amp'd Mobile had discussed the possibility of offering racier fare in a meeting with industry analysts in March, according to Neil Strother, an analyst with Jupiter Research.</p>
        <p>While Amp'd, based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., declined to comment on the bankruptcy filing, analysts believed that the company would be more cautious in proceeding for fear of alienating subscribers while it worked though its financial difficulties.</p>
        <p>Members of CTIA, a wireless industry trade group, agreed not to introduce sex-oriented programming until age-verification technology is in place.</p>
        <p>People who are determined to download pornography to their cellphones can do so today, but it must be done from third-party Web sites designed for mobile phones.</p>
