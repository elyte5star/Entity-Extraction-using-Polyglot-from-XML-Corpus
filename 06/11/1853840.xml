        <p>As the sidewalks along Fifth Avenue began to fill and the bands took their places behind the police and the politicians for yesterday's Puerto Rican Day Parade, Tony Flores took a deep breath and smiled.</p>
        <p>He had been there for the first one, in 1958, marching with the Boy Scouts of Troop 498 from Williamsburg, Brooklyn; it was a novelty then, much smaller and at least a dozen blocks shorter. Mr. Flores kept attending the parades even after he moved to Georgia in 1980 to become a marketing manager for Coca-Cola.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as a tribute to the parade's 50th year, he came bearing a treat: 20Paso Fino show horses that danced for the crowd.</p>
        <p>''I love the culture, the music, the evolution of salsa and the traditional dances, and the evolution of my people,'' Mr. Flores said. ''This is a special moment. And today I'm not just watching. I'm a part of it.''</p>
        <p>By 11 a.m., when the parade officially began, at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, the crowd was swelling to its legendary proportions, a pulsing mass of many thousands of people. Many waved Puerto Rican flags and hoisted children on shoulders to chants of ''Que viva Puerto Rico'' and ''Boricua.''</p>
        <p>The horses were merely one spectacle among many. Men had painted their faces with the colors of the Puerto Rican flag; red, white and blue with a single white star over an eye or on the forehead. Children and teenagers blew into whistles and noisemakers while others did their best to imitate the sounds of the coquí frog, the island's mascot and a native creature: ''Co-KEE, co-KEE.'' Whenever a TV camera passed, the screams got even louder.</p>
        <p>Some marchers donned colorful dragon costumes, many 10 feet high. The sounds of reggaetón and its musical elders, salsa, bomba, plena and danzón, erupted almost spontaneously. There were marching bands and choreographed dancers. Young men tried their smoothest lines on young women while fathers offered back stern looks before cracking smiles. Even some police officers did a two-step.</p>
        <p>There were the requisite celebrities, including Geraldo Rivera; Jennifer Lopez and her husband, Marc Anthony; and Ricky Martin, so idolized that the organizers anointed him not the grand marshal of the parade, but the ''king.''</p>
        <p>There were the politicians, like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; Representative Charles B. Rangel; Senator Charles E. Schumer; Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá, the governor of Puerto Rico; and a gaggle of City Council members.</p>
        <p>There was also Miguela Rodriguez, whose son Angelo, 22, was killed in a car accident on April 5, soon after starting a job as a subway conductor for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
        <p>''This was his thing,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said. ''He would be out here from about 9 a.m. until the end.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rodriguez stood quietly at 86th Street, where the parade ended. She and a few relatives and friends held a large Puerto Rican flag with ''R.I.P. Angelo Rodriguez'' scrawled on its red and white stripes.</p>
        <p>''I'm a Boricua, but I never come to the parades,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said, using the term, derived from an earlier name of the island, that many Puerto Ricans use to describe themselves. ''It's just too much for me, but I made it out here today in his honor. He was so proud of his people, so proud of his heritage. He loved being Boricua.''</p>
        <p>The parade moved along the majestic avenue all afternoon, past some of the most expensive real estate on the planet. Some restaurants close to the parade route hired security guards to restrict access to bathrooms, while most of the Fifth Avenue buildings heeded a request by the mayor and did not put up barricades.</p>
        <p>A number of buildings had done so after the 2000 parade, when groups of men groped and sexually assaulted women in Central Park as the parade disbanded.</p>
        <p>Police officers stood a few yards apart along much of the parade route yesterday, and some men wearing the black and yellow of the Latin Kings gang were seen being arrested. The Police Department did not disclose the number of parade arrests or any of the charges.</p>
        <p>But the parade itself went off with barely a hitch, especially for those carrying on its traditions.</p>
        <p>''My children are culturally diverse: They are half Puerto Rican and Jamaican,'' said Christine Figueroa, 33, an insurance broker from the Bronx who came with her parents and three children. ''It is important for them to know about their culture, and to be here to celebrate with their people.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2007, Wednesday  An article on Monday about the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan misstated the difference in length between this year's parade and the one in 1958, which one paradegoer, Tony Flores, took part in as a Boy Scout from Brooklyn. The 1958 parade was eight blocks shorter, not ''at least a dozen.''</p>
