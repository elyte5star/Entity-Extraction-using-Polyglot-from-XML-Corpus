        <p>The governor signed a bill last week that prevents landlords from penalizing victims of domestic violence if they break their leases.</p>
        <p>''The sponsors of the bill note that many domestic violence victims would be safer if they could move to a location where their abuser cannot find them,'' Mr. Spitzer wrote in a message explaining his approval of the legislation.</p>
        <p>''Although allowing individuals to break their contractual obligations should occur only rarely, it is appropriate where, as here, it would substantially increase the safety of a vulnerable population,'' he added.</p>
