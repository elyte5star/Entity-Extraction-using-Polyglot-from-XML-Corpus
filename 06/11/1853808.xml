        <p>T-Pain  ''Epiphany''  (Zomba/Sony BMG)</p>
        <p>T-Pain is the undisputed heavyweight champion of cyborg soul, and for the past few years his computer-processed voice has been a staple on pop radio. Beneath the electronic ache of his 2005 breakthrough hits, ''I'm Sprung'' and ''I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper),'' you could detect a sly joke about love's power. Apparently the right woman can turn any man into a robot. His new album, ''Epiphany,'' has already spawned a No. 1 hit, ''Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')''; the similarly-themed follow-up is ''Bartender,'' featuring Akon, who is one of the album's executive producers. And in the opening track, ''Tallahassee Love,'' T-Pain pays tribute both to his hometown and to Roger Troutman, the funk pioneer who helped popularize the vocal effect that T-Pain is known for.</p>

        <p>T-Pain is the undisputed heavyweight champion of cyborg soul, and for the past few years his computer-processed voice has been a staple on pop radio. Beneath the electronic ache of his 2005 breakthrough hits, ''I'm Sprung'' and ''I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper),'' you could detect a sly joke about love's power.

        <p>But don't be too distracted by the funny voice: T-Pain also produced every song on the album, and his thumping beats are the secret behind his success. In ''Backseat Action'' he rides a twitchy, syncopated rhythm, while ''Church'' hints at antsy new wave. And while ''Suicide'' is a perplexing bit of melodrama (an incautious man wails, ''She had H-I-Veee''), the last track, ''Sounds Bad,'' is a happy surprise: a bittersweet tribute to a desperate man. ''Got the whole house runnin' on a generator/No good food in my 'frigedator,'' sings the cyborg, and he sounds less robotic than many of his human counterparts.</p>
