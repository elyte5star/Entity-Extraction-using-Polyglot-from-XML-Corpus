        <p>As the conflict between Lebanese soldiers and militants inspired by Al Qaeda entered its fourth week on Sunday, there was sporadic fighting at the Nahr al Bared Palestinian refugee camp where most of the earlier battles had taken place.</p>
        <p>The violence followed a day of heavy fighting with the militant group Fatah al Islam that killed 11 soldiers, according to an army spokesman. Six of the soldiers died Saturday and five died of their wounds on Sunday, he said, and more than 40 others were wounded, some seriously.</p>
        <p>The fighting Saturday was part of a fresh offensive by the government, according to the spokesman, who is not authorized to give his name to the press. He said the army had fired artillery and the militants had fought back with mortar and sniper fire.</p>
        <p>The army's casualties from Saturday were the heaviest in a single day since the fighting began May 20, when 23 soldiers were killed in a daylong battle. The latest casualties raised the total number of soldiers killed to 58, the spokesman said. At least 41 militants and 31 civilians have been killed since the siege began, he said.</p>
        <p>Shahine Shahine, a spokesman for Fatah al Islam, told Agence France-Presse by telephone from inside the camp that four of its fighters were killed and six were wounded Saturday. It was not possible to verify his claims independently.</p>
        <p>Rescue workers took advantage of a short break in the fighting during the day Sunday to remove two bodies from the camp. It was not immediately clear when they had died or whether they were Palestinian civilians or Fatah al Islam fighters.</p>
        <p>The Red Cross and the Palestinian Red Crescent also evacuated at least 50 civilians from the camp on Sunday. Most of Nahr al Bared's 40,000 residents have already fled the camp, but several thousand are believed to still be trapped inside.</p>
        <p>Also on Sunday, a French envoy arrived in Beirut to meet Lebanese leaders in preparation for a meeting later this month aimed at breaking a political deadlock between Lebanon's Western-backed governing coalition and the opposition, which includes the militant group Hezbollah, Reuters reported. Hezbollah has not said if it will take part in the meeting, which is to be held in France, Reuters said.</p>
