        <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right party was on course to win an overwhelming parliamentary majority after the first round of French legislative elections on Sunday, cementing his power to enact changes that he says are needed to rescue France from economic and social malaise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy's party, the Union for a Popular Movement won 39.54 percent of the vote, according to a final tally by the Interior Ministry. That could give the party and its allies as many as 501 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the second-round vote on June 17, pollsters said.</p>
        <p>The main opposition, the Socialist Party, received 24.73 percent, meaning that it could lose more than half of its 149 seats, pollsters projected. The result reinforced the disarray on the left since its presidential candidate, Ségolène Royal, lost to Mr. Sarkozy last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy says he plans to cut taxes, tighten punishment for repeat lawbreakers and make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers.</p>
