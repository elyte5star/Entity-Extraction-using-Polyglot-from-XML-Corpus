        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Free Judges' Pay,'' by Judith S. Kaye (Op-Ed, June 7):</p>
        <p>I agree with Chief Judge Kaye on the importance of keeping our ''democracy prosperous and free,'' with ''powers balanced, debts recovered, promises kept and justice done.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest single issue in achieving these goals is equal educational opportunity -- and indeed this has been a major judicial issue in New York State for many years.</p>
        <p>In this light, I am struck by Judge Kaye's worry that judges earning a minimum of $136,700 cannot ''afford to continue to live in New York and educate their children.'' Presumably, she means that they cannot afford expensive private educations for their children.</p>
        <p>Setting judges' salaries at a level that guarantees their children access to elite educations is not necessarily a good thing.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a few judicial offspring in the public schools would have a beneficial effect on suits such as Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State of New York, which seek adequate, constitutionally mandated financing levels for state schools.</p>
        <p>Tom Riordan  South Orange, N.J., June 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In addition to a pay increase for New York state judges, a bonus should be given to those judges who live in the judicial district in which they serve.</p>
        <p>Residing in the judicial area would give the judge an in-depth knowledge of his or her community and provide the community with a sense that the judge is in touch with its activities, problems and dreams.</p>
        <p>By the way, a residency bonus should also apply to teachers, police officer and firefighters.</p>
