        <p>CASALE--Ann Grimshaw, artist, died in Sag Harbor on May 7, 2007 at the age of 78. A remarkable woman who believed in herself and her ability to achieve whatever she reached for. She gave birth to ten children in thirteen years. A gifted and provocative painter, primarily in watercolor and oil, she began her study of art at The Art Student League in her twenties and continued it throughout her life. She is survived by her ten children and thirteen grandchildren. There will be a memorial service June 16 at 11am at the Wainscott Chapel in Wainscott, with a reception to follow at The Art Barge in Amagansett, where a collection of her work will be shown. She will be buried in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla at 11am on June 17.</p>
