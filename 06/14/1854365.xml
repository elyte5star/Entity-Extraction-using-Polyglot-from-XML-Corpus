        <p>South Africa's municipal workers joined provincial and national government employees in a bitter strike on Wednesday, walking off their jobs to march by the thousands in scores of cities and bringing activity in some places to a halt.</p>
        <p>The strike is in its 13th day, and unions representing the police, prison officers and some soldiers threatened to join it if no wage agreement was reached by Friday, despite a ban on walkouts by workers in essential services.</p>
        <p>Talks were scheduled to resume on Thursday, but a quick settlement appeared unlikely after union negotiators rejected a new government offer to increase wages by 7.25 percent, compared to an earlier 6.5 percent offer.</p>
        <p>The Congress of South African Trade Unions, or Cosatu, called the new offer an insult and said it would not alter its demand for a 10 percent salary increase. ''The government has a choice,'' the union's general secretary, Vavi Zwelinzima, told workers in Cape Town. ''Do they see a long, long winter, or do they want to settle?''</p>
        <p>The trade unions are allied with the African National Congress in a political coalition that controls the national government.</p>
        <p>But union officials have been increasingly critical of President Thabo Mbeki, who is also the African National Congress leader, and are mounting an effort to oust him from the party's top office at a convention this year.</p>
        <p>Many political and labor experts see the strike as a test of wills between political forces that are likely to clash at the convention.</p>
        <p>The unions had predicted that the sympathy strike on Wednesday by municipal workers, joining the 700,000 employees already on strike, would bring the nation to a standstill.</p>
        <p>But news agencies reported that the turnout was geographically spotty. In Durban, a labor stronghold, the downtown was all but shut down after taxi drivers and some bus companies stopped service. In Johannesburg, transportation workers stayed on the job, and most businesses operated normally despite a downtown march by 15,000 strikers.</p>
        <p>Fears that the strike might turn violent were unfounded on Wednesday. Striking municipal workers lighted a small fire outside Cape Town's convention center and threw garbage into the building's concourse, but little unrest was seen elsewhere. Durban's biggest bus operator suspended service after protesters stoned buses in some outlying areas.</p>
