        <p>The Rockefeller Foundation announced yesterday the creation of a $2.5 million New York City Cultural Innovation Fund to promote new directions in the arts. Grants from $50,000 to $250,000 will be awarded for new creative work in the visual, performing and media arts that demonstrates an engagement with the issues shaping New York City's future cultural and civic agenda. The projects will involve partnerships that connect cultural institutions with universities and the private sector, or that present new solutions for longstanding limitations on cultural expansion. The foundation also named three advisers to the fund: Lowery Stokes Sims, former president of the Studio Museum in Harlem; David Thorpe, global director of innovation at Ogilvy Worldwide; and Andrew Zolli, curator of the annual Pop!Tech conference. Initial proposals are due on July 20. Grants will be announced in November.</p>
