        <p>The Rev. Billy Graham announced that he and his wife, Ruth Bell Graham, have decided to be buried at the new Billy Graham Library in Charlotte. Mrs. Graham, who has been bedridden for several years, has reportedly slipped into a coma. Disagreements between the Grahams' children over the couple's burial site became public last year. Mrs. Graham, 86, preferred a long-planned site at the Cove, a retreat center in Asheville that she helped design for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Asheville is nearer to the couple's mountain homestead in Montreat.</p>
