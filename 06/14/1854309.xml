        <p>Most people discard chipped plates and never notice the way their kitchen drains look, but Joana Meroz, a Netherlands-based designer, treats these unwanted and unnoticed objects as a blank canvas. In her ''Ornamented Life'' collection, sold at the Future Perfect in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Ms. Meroz embellishes cracked porcelain plates (and cups, bowls and serving pieces) with gold dust and plant-like drawings, left and above, making the undesirable desirable again. In her hands, a stainless-steel drain stopper, bottom left, takes on the look of lace, thanks to precise laser-cutting (although with a diameter of about 2 3/4 inches, it may be a tad small for the average American kitchen sink). The Crackery collection starts at $18 for a cup, and the drain stopper is $72; at the Future Perfect, 115 North Sixth Street (Berry Street), Brooklyn, (718) 599-6278.</p>
