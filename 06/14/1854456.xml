        <p>An article on Saturday about the conviction of a Brooklyn man, Gregory Zalevsky, for the 2004 murder of his girlfriend, Irina Ilyina, misstated their ages. He is 52, not 57, and she was 31 at the time of her death, not 34. (Both errors appeared in an article about his trial on June 2, and the incorrect age for Ms. Ilyina first appeared in an article about Mr. Zalevsky's arrest on July 8, 2004.)</p>
