        <p>The National Basketball Players Association yesterday announced its initiative to feed one million people in Kenya, through its formal partnership with the organization Feed the Children.</p>
        <p>The executive director of the players union, Billy Hunter, said at a news conference in Cleveland that members of the union would travel in July to distribute 11 million pounds of rice to drought-stricken communities and schools in Nairobi.</p>
        <p>''We feel that as our game continues to grow globally, that we have a responsibility to those communities, similar to the communities that we play and reside in now,'' said Derek Fisher, the president of the players union and a point guard for the Utah Jazz.</p>
        <p>''When you think about the possibility of being able to feed a million people and the fact that a million people need to be fed is truly amazing. We feel great to be able to have a small part in hopefully changing their lives and having an impact on the world.''</p>
