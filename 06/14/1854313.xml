        <p>After a close brush with demolition and an arduous move from a Chicago suburb to a Pennsylvania forest, a 1957 house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright opens today for tours and overnight stays. Three years ago, Danic Homes, an Illinois developer, agreed to donate the house, below, to the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, a nonprofit group that arranged for it to be dismantled. Then all the pieces -- including mahogany siding and paneling, 1950s kitchen appliances and Danish teak furniture -- were packed into trailers. ''It was a major jigsaw puzzle,'' said Thomas Papinchak, a builder who said he spent ''close to seven figures'' buying and reassembling the components at Polymath Park, a 125-acre resort he owns in Acme, Pa., near Pittsburgh, which was already home to two 1960s houses designed by Peter Berndtson, a Wright apprentice. The Duncan House, named after its original owners, sleeps six and costs $385 per night for three people, then $50 per night for each additional person. For information: www.polymathpark.com.</p>
