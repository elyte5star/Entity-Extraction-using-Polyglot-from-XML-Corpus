        <p>Temple, an outdoor pavilion, has a removable teak floor, a retractable fabric roof and curtain rods on all four sides for privacy. Jason Champion, the Cherry Hill, N.J.-based product designer who created the pavilion and the Goa collection of chairs, above, for Tidelli, an outdoor furniture company in Salvador, Brazil, said it could be used as a dining area, a lounge or even an airy guest room. The 10-foot-square structure ($17,465) and the swivel chairs ($1,275 each) have powder-coated aluminum frames covered in polyvinyl chloride, a material that contains recycled components. They come in six colors: white, black, beige, chocolate, orange and chartreuse. Information is available from Mr. Champion's company, Design Kollection, which is distributing the product in the United States: (941) 921-6780 or jason@designkollection.com.</p>
