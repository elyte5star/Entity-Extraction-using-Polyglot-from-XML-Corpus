        <p>In a city with few backyards, everyone loves a park -- but not many people consider who is going to pay for all that grass.</p>
        <p>New York City is in the midst of one of the most ambitious expansions of its park system in history, but a report by the Regional Plan Association, scheduled to be released today, questions whether the city and state will be able to maintain all the new green space.</p>
        <p>The report by the independent planning group said the cost of operating some 55 miles of planned waterfront parks alone would be $100 million annually -- almost one-third of the park department's $355 million budget. The city has not yet estimated its operational costs for the parks.</p>
        <p>The 700 acres of parks analyzed by the group include Hudson River Park and Riverside Park South along the Hudson River in Manhattan, and parks in various stages of planning or development, including Brooklyn Bridge Park, the South Bronx Greenway, the Harlem Piers and a string of parks for the Brooklyn waterfront from Greenpoint to Sunset Park.</p>
        <p>Waterfront parks are typically more expensive to build and to maintain because of the costs of underwater construction on piers and the parks' proximity to salt air, which causes material, particularly wooden benches and piers, to deteriorate more quickly.</p>
        <p>The report comes a few weeks after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced an initiative that includes the goal of creating enough green space so that by 2030, every New Yorker lives within a 10-minute walk of a park.</p>
        <p>Adrian Benepe, the city parks commissioner, said yesterday that for the past several years the city had been projecting potential maintenance costs and had sought financing before opening new parks.</p>
        <p>''The report represents a legitimate concern, and it's exactly the right thing for them to worry about, but the sea change we've seen in this administration is that when we've created new parks we've had extra staff allocated to maintain the parks,'' Mr. Benepe said.</p>
        <p>In recent years, as parkland has replaced abandoned or underused manufacturing and shipping facilities along the Hudson, Harlem and East Rivers, the state and city have turned to nontraditional methods to pay to operate the new parks.</p>
        <p>For instance, Hudson River Park, which is about half completed, is paid for in part with revenue from a parking garage on Pier 40.</p>
        <p>Riverside Park South receives financing as part of a fee paid by neighboring homeowners, and Brooklyn Bridge Park, where construction is to start later this year, is to be financed by developers of apartment units that will be built on the park's edge.</p>
        <p>In the past, with a few exceptions -- including Bryant Park and Battery Park City, where businesses and residents respectively, pay a park maintenance fee -- the city and state have paid for and maintained parks directly.</p>
        <p>''Today's new parks seem, if not to be required to pay for themselves, to at least have some associated revenue stream,'' the report said. ''Based on the average costs of currently operating and future city and state parks, new waterfront parks will require around $135,000 an acre each year for management, maintenance, security and creative programming.''</p>
        <p>The report criticized some of the new arrangements, particularly financing formulas that may allow wealthier neighborhoods to have better maintained parks than poor areas, and parks where operations and maintenance have been left to developers.</p>
        <p>''Our sense is that this model has not been a recipe for success,'' said Robert Pirani, director of environmental programs at the Regional Plan Association.</p>
        <p>The association's report will be available to the public at www.rpa.org.</p>
