        <p>James Carpinello, above, who is playing the lead male role, Sonny, in the Douglas Carter Beane musical ''Xanadu,'' currently in previews at the Helen Hayes Theater, badly injured his foot during a rehearsal on Tuesday. (This kind of thing happens when much of a show takes place on roller skates.) Mr. Carpinello was seeing doctors yesterday, a spokesman for ''Xanadu'' said. Although Mr. Carpinello is not leaving the show permanently, the spokesman added, it was not clear how long he would be out. His understudy, Andre Ward, is stepping into the role, but the production is looking for a longer-term replacement. Producers have decided to postpone the opening, originally scheduled for June 26, but they have not set a new date.</p>
