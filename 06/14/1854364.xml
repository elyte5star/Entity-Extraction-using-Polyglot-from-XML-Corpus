        <p>Violence increased throughout much of Iraq in recent months, despite a security crackdown in Baghdad that at least temporarily reduced sectarian killings there, according to a quarterly assessment of security conditions issued Wednesday by the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>The report, which analyzed data from February through early May, said it was too early to say whether the security effort in Baghdad would achieve lasting security gains. And it described in more detail than officials had until now how security conditions in other parts of the country had worsened when American and Iraqi forces shifted in large numbers into the capital.</p>
        <p>''The aggregate level of violence in Iraq remained relatively unchanged during this reporting period,'' the report said. ''Violence has decreased'' in Baghdad and in Anbar Province, which have long been the country's most violent areas, ''but has increased in most provinces, particularly in outlying areas around Baghdad and in Nineva and Diyala Provinces.'' Attacks have also increased in Basra Province in the south, because of fighting between rival Shiite militants, some of whom fled Baghdad because of the security crackdown, it added.</p>
        <p>Although precise data are not included in the report, attacks on civilians and Iraqi and American troops increased by 2 percent from the previous quarter, the report said. The average number of attacks has exceeded 1,000 per week since the beginning of this year through early May, the highest level since the American invasion in 2003, it said.</p>
        <p>Even the decrease in violence in Baghdad may be temporary, the report noted. Gen. David H. Petraeus and other American commanders have recently confirmed that the number of sectarian killings in Baghdad, while still below levels seen last year, has begun climbing again.</p>
        <p>The report also criticized Iraq's leaders for failing to take advantage of the additional security in Baghdad to reach agreements on draft laws, like measures apportioning oil revenue and setting a timetable for new provincial elections, that the United States says are vital to improve prospects for reconciliation.</p>
        <p>''Reaching consensus among a wide array of political factions with competing agendas has proven difficult, and efforts to pass this legislation are progressing more slowly than desired,'' the report concluded.</p>
        <p>In addition, the average number of Iraqi civilian casualties each day exceeded 100, also a record level. Much of the increase can be attributed to suicide attacks, often involving vehicles packed with explosives, which went up to 58 in March from 26 in January and increased again in April.</p>
        <p>American troops are increasingly being attacked by deadly hidden bombs, called explosively formed penetrators, or E.F.P.'s. Attacks using these munitions were at an all-time high in April, the report said.</p>
        <p>The 230 American deaths in April and May was the highest total for any two-month period since the war began, and 80 percent of the deaths were caused by makeshift explosives, the highest level ever, up from 50 percent in January.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration officials have said they lack evidence that Iran's top leaders are knowingly involved in sending the bombs into Iraq. But the report directly blames the Quds Force, a militant wing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, for giving E.F.P.'s and other aid to Shiite militants in Iraq.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey, who recently finished a two-year tour overseeing the training and equipping of Iraqi forces, said that Iraqi units arriving in Baghdad as part of the security effort were on average at only 75 percent of their mandated strength. He added that one in six Iraqi policemen who had been trained by the Americans had been killed or wounded, had deserted or had otherwise disappeared.</p>
        <p>General Dempsey, who is taking over as deputy commander of the Central Command, which has responsibility for Iraq, repeated a concern expressed by other American commanders. He said he believed that the Iraqi security forces would have to be expanded again next year to meet requirements for forces in Baghdad. General Petraeus has previously said 20,000 more Iraqi troops may have to be added.</p>
        <p>General Dempsey's assessment closely tracked that of the Pentagon report released Wednesday. When American officials announced the new Baghdad security plan in January, they said Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki had pledged that his largely Shiite government would not interfere in the security crackdown by limiting where troops could go and which units would be involved.</p>
        <p>''To date, operations in Baghdad indicate that Iraqi government delivery on these commitments has been uneven,'' the report said. ''For example, there have been reports of political involvement by some leaders in tactical and operational decisions that bypass the standard chain of (military) command.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether he expected that the next Iraqi units to rotate into Baghdad would be even more thinly staffed and less capable than those in the capital now, General Dempsey replied, ''I'm absolutely convinced that's exactly what we'll see.''</p>
