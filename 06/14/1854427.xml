        <p>Bob Dylan Wins Asturias Prize</p>
        <p>Bob Dylan, right, was named the winner yesterday of the 2007 Prince of Asturias Prize for Art, given by the Prince of Asturias Foundation and named for its patron, Crown Prince Felipe of Asturias, heir to the Spanish throne, Agence France-Presse reported. The jury said, ''Austere in form and profound in message, Dylan marries music and poetry in a body of work that has set an example and influenced the sentimental education of millions of people.'' The $66,000 prize will be presented at a ceremony in October. Last year's winner of the prize for art was the Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar.</p>
        <p>Despite Honors, Misery for 'Company'</p>
        <p>''Company'' may have won the Tony Award for best revival of a musical on Sunday night, but that accolade, along with honors from the Drama Desk, the Outer Critics Circle and the Drama League, won't prevent the final curtain from falling on it on July 1. At its closing, the show, a Stephen Sondheim and George Furth creation, directed by John Doyle and starring Raúl Esparza, will have played 247 regular performances and 34 previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. A stage adaptation of the Kurt Vonnegut novel ''Slaughterhouse-Five,'' adapted by Eric Simonson of the Steppenwolf Theater Company and presented by the Godlight Theater Company, is to have its premiere in September for a six-week run at 59E59 Theaters. Angela Lansbury, starring on Broadway in ''Deuce'' at the Music Box Theater, will receive the Edwin Booth Lifetime Achievement Award of the Players Club, on Gramercy Park, in ceremonies there on June 24.</p>
        <p>The Game Spurns Offer</p>
        <p>The rapper the Game rejected a prosecutor's offer yesterday to exchange a guilty plea for a sentence of time already served on a misdemeanor charge of impersonating a police officer, for which he was arrested last year in Manhattan, The Associated Press reported. Although the swap of the guilty plea for the time that the Game, 27, of Glendale, Calif., spent waiting to appear in court after his arrest would have ended the case, his lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said outside Criminal Court in Manhattan: ''Why should he plead guilty to bogus charges for a non-jail sentence if he's innocent? And he is innocent.'' Judge James Burke scheduled a return court date of Sept. 20 for the Game, whose real name is Jayceon Taylor. In California he is facing charges of making a criminal threat and possessing a firearm in a school zone in an incident in February in Los Angeles. Mr. Lichtman said the Game would be on a concert tour of Europe for the next two months.</p>
        <p>Bach Books Add Up</p>
        <p>In the conclusion of a 55-year effort, German researchers have completed the final volume of a new collection of the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach, The Associated Press reported. Christoph Wolff, director of the Bach Archive in Leipzig, said the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, or New Bach Edition, compiled by the Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute in Göttingen, consists of 100 volumes. The first was published in 1953. The cantatas alone fill more than 40 volumes. Mr. Wolff said some contatas and several sonatas previously attributed to Bach had been determined not to have been written by him and were removed from the collection. He continued, ''More complicated is the content of 'The St. Luke Passion,' which as a whole has been found not to be authentic but still contains one chorus composed by Bach.'' He said the new collection includes 47 recently discovered pieces not found in Wolfgang Schmieder's Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, or BWV, generally regarded by musicians and musicologists as the standard catalog of the composer's works.</p>
