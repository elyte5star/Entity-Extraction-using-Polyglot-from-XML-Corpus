        <p>In recent years, the Bush administration has recast the federal government's role in civil rights by aggressively pursuing religion-oriented cases while significantly diminishing its involvement in the traditional area of race.</p>
        <p>Paralleling concerns of many conservative groups, the Justice Department has successfully argued in a number of cases that government agencies, employers or private organizations have improperly suppressed religious expression in situations that the Constitution's drafters did not mean to restrict.</p>
        <p>The shift at the Justice Department has significantly altered the government's civil rights mission, said Brian K. Landsberg, a law professor at the University of the Pacific and a former Justice Department lawyer under both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>
        <p>''Not until recently has anyone in the department considered religious discrimination such a high priority,'' Professor Landsberg said. ''No one had ever considered it to be of the same magnitude as race or national origin.''</p>
        <p>Cynthia Magnuson, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement that the agency had ''worked diligently to enforce the federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on religion.''</p>
        <p>The changes are evident in a variety of actions:</p>
        <p>Intervening in federal court cases on behalf of religion-based groups like the Salvation Army that assert they have the right to discriminate in hiring in favor of people who share their beliefs even though they are running charitable programs with federal money.</p>
        <p>Supporting groups that want to send home religious literature with schoolchildren; in one case, the government helped win the right of a group in Massachusetts to distribute candy canes as part of a religious message that the red stripes represented the blood of Christ.</p>
        <p>Vigorously enforcing a law enacted by Congress in 2000 that allows churches and other places of worship to be free of some local zoning restrictions. The division has brought more than two dozen lawsuits on behalf of churches, synagogues and mosques.</p>
        <p>Taking on far fewer hate crimes and cases in which local law enforcement officers may have violated someone's civil rights. The resources for these traditional cases have instead been used to investigate trafficking cases, typically involving foreign women used in the sex trade, a favored issue of the religious right.</p>
        <p>Sharply reducing the complex lawsuits that challenge voting plans that might dilute the strength of black voters. The department initiated only one such case through the early part of this year, compared with eight in a comparable period in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Along with its changed civil rights mission, the department has also tried to overhaul the roster of government lawyers who deal with civil rights. The agency has transferred or demoted some experienced civil rights litigators while bringing in lawyers, including graduates of religious-affiliated law schools and some people vocal about their faith, who favor the new priorities. That has created some unease, with some career lawyers disdainfully referring to the newcomers as ''holy hires.''</p>
        <p>The department's emphasis has been embraced by some groups representing Muslims, Jews and especially Christian conservatives, who have long complained that the federal government ignored their grievances about discrimination.</p>
        <p>''We live in a society that is becoming more religiously diverse, even by the hour,'' said Kevin Seamus Hasson, who founded the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty 12 years ago. ''So it's entirely appropriate and slightly overdue that the Justice Department is paying more attention to the various frictions that increasing religious diversity is causing in the society.''</p>
        <p>Combating racism remains an important mission, Mr. Hasson said, but one that has changed over the years. ''We can now deal with the problems of racism more effectively on a more local level,'' he argued. ''We don't always need the federal government to come riding over the hill.''</p>
        <p>Some religious figures, though, are more wary about the changes at the Justice Department. Robert Edgar, president of the National Council of Churches, a liberal-leaning group, agreed that it was important to take on issues like religious discrimination and human trafficking.</p>
        <p>But the problems of race and poverty in America ''still require the highest caliber of attention,'' said Mr. Edgar, who cited the flawed government response to New Orleans and its mostly poor, black population after Hurricane Katrina. He said he was distrustful of the Justice Department's leadership to make appropriate decisions as to the nation's civil rights priorities.</p>
        <p>A New Mission</p>
        <p>Some critics say that many of the Justice Department's religious-oriented initiatives are outside its mandate from Congress. While statutes prohibit religious discrimination in areas like employment and housing, no laws address some of the issues in which the department has become involved.</p>
        <p>''They are engaging in freewheeling social engineering,'' said Ayesha Khan, counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and ''using the power of the federal government to put in place an ideological, not constitutional agenda.''</p>
        <p>The department declined to make available for interviews Assistant Attorney General Wan J. Kim, who heads the civil rights division, or Eric Treene, who holds the newly created position of special counsel for religious discrimination.</p>
        <p>Ms. Magnuson, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said it was justified in devoting so much attention to the issue because Congress has demonstrated its interest by including religion in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and enacting the 2000 law involving zoning restrictions, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.</p>
        <p>Ms. Magnuson also said the department had not diminished its interest in enforcing racial and national origin discrimination cases. The changes at the Justice Department began under Attorney General John Ashcroft, but have accelerated under Alberto R. Gonzales, his successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gonzales has increasingly cited his agency's record on behalf of religious causes as among his most important accomplishments, often noting the successful intervention in cases on behalf of people who had suffered discrimination for wearing Muslim head coverings. In speeches, he routinely says that religious freedom is the nation's ''first freedom because our founders saw fit to place it first in the Bill of Rights.''</p>
        <p>President Bush has also talked of the department's religion-related activities in appearances before religious conservatives, an important element of his support. Aside from any political benefit of satisfying conservative groups, the Justice Department's shift has brought a more subtle dividend: a defense to the criticism leveled at past Republican administrations that they were half-hearted about civil rights enforcement.</p>
        <p>Changing Mission</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has avoided that problem by changing the civil rights mission to something its Justice Department can take on with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>The department has prevailed in many, if not most of the cases in which it has become involved. It has, in effect, duplicated in the religious arena its past success in cases involving race and national origin.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the department has sharply reduced its efforts to combat voting rights plans that may dilute black electoral strength.</p>
        <p>Ms. Magnuson, the department spokeswoman, said that the civil rights division had brought more voting rights lawsuits under Mr. Bush than had been brought in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>But an examination of the Justice Department's Web site listing of the cases brought through early 2007 shows that many of them involved a different part of the law, one that requires voting materials be available in languages other than English in places with high concentrations of Asian and Hispanic voters.</p>
        <p>Joseph D. Rich, who recently stepped down as head of the voting rights section after a 37-year career at Justice, said that only the federal government had the resources to bring voting dilution cases, while private groups have been able to bring the language cases. The civil rights division also brought the first case ever on behalf of white voters, alleging in 2005 that a black political leader in Noxubee County, Miss., was intimidating whites at the polls.</p>
        <p>The shift in priorities at the criminal section of the civil rights division has been especially stark. The criminal section -- which previously had mostly focused on hate crimes or lawsuits against police officers who may have violated someone's civil rights -- began taking on human trafficking cases that had previously been handled elsewhere.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Bush's second term, the section brought dozens of cases against people charged under a new law with bringing women into the country to work in brothels. The new employees with religious backgrounds were enthusiastic about such cases, seeing them akin to combating slavery, a former career lawyer in the division said.</p>
        <p>Pursuing trafficking cases, rather than those involving hate crimes or police abuse, was seen as important to moving ahead in the department, current and former career officials said. They added that political appointees in supervisory positions frequently vetoed proposed hate crime investigations or questioned them to death.</p>
        <p>''You only needed for that to happen a few times and people got the message they shouldn't be eager to send up such cases,'' said one lawyer who would talk only on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Rigel C. Oliveri, a law professor at the University of Missouri who worked in the civil rights division during the Clinton and early Bush years, said it became increasingly frustrating to bring what she said were worthy civil rights cases, because the political appointees would not act on them. ''It was like a black hole,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Whatever cases may have been slowed or ignored, some religious leaders said they were grateful for actions the department had taken.</p>
        <p>The Rev. N. J. L'Heureux, the executive director of the Queens Federation of Churches in New York, said the department had helped several Christian, Muslim and Jewish congregations deal with local governments trying to block houses of worship in neighborhoods. In Hollywood, Fla., for example, the department successfully sued the city for denying a permit to an Orthodox synagogue.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Mr. L'Heureux said, an inquiry from Mr. Treene, the special religious affairs counsel, had been enough to encourage local governments to drop their resistance. The civil rights division favorably resolved 16 of 26 zoning investigations simply by expressing interest in them, according to the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Kareem W. Shora, the executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said that Mr. Treene had also intervened in cases the group brought to him about Arab prison inmates having access to prayer opportunities.</p>
        <p>In so-called equal-access cases, the department has mostly won court rulings allowing religious organizations like the Child Evangelism Fellowship to have the same access to public school students as nonreligious groups, a principle generally approved by a divided Supreme Court in 2001.</p>
        <p>In the candy cane case, for example, school officials in Westfield, Mass., had suspended students for handing out candy canes with religious messages, saying it was disruptive and lurid. The students said that the ''J'' shape represented Jesus and the red stripes his blood, the white his purity. In a pending case from San Diego, the government defended the city's campground lease to the Boy Scouts, which had been challenged because of the group's religious tenets. The department has also challenged so-called Blaine amendments, which are state constitutional provisions enforcing separation of church and state more rigidly than does the United States Constitution. The federal government sued because the amendments could impede Mr. Bush's religion-based initiative, which provides money to religious groups for social programs.</p>
        <p>Reshaping the Staff</p>
        <p>As it has reoriented its priorities, the department has also tried to remake the cast of government lawyers who enforce civil rights. A number of career lawyers who served as section heads or deputies in the civil rights division have been replaced.</p>
        <p>In Congressional testimony in March, Mr. Rich said seven managers had been removed or marginalized for what he characterized as political reasons or perceived disloyalty. Department officials acknowledge the changes, but dispute the reasons.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Ashcroft arranged for the agency's senior political appointees to take over the decades-old system used to hire recent law school graduates for entry-level career jobs that are supposed to be nonpartisan.</p>
        <p>Under the system, known as the honors program, nonpolitical career lawyers had screened applicants. Those selected were almost exclusively graduates of top-ranked law schools and often had had prestigious judicial clerkships or other relevant experience.</p>
        <p>Monica M. Goodling, a former senior aide to Mr. Gonzales, testified to a House committee last month that she had improperly used politics to hire some people as assistant federal prosecutors and for other civil service jobs, a possible violation of federal employment laws.</p>
        <p>But the pattern of hiring on an ideological basis was more widespread than what Ms. Goodling described, according to interviews and department statistics.</p>
        <p>Figures provided by the department show that from 2003 through 2006, there was a notable increase of hirings from religious-affiliated institutions like Regent University and Ave Maria University. The department hired eight from those two schools in that period, compared to 50 from Harvard and 13 from Yale.</p>
        <p>Several career lawyers said that some political appointees favored the religious-oriented employees, intervening to steer $1,000 to $4,000 annual merit bonuses to them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Oliveri and several other law professors said placement officers and faculty at their schools found that graduates seeking work at the Justice Department had a better chance by cleansing their rÃ©sumÃ©s of liberal affiliations while emphasizing ties to the Federalist Society, a Washington conservative group, or membership in a religious fellowship.</p>
        <p>Ms. Oliveri recalled that when she was hired in 2000 by the Justice Department, she was impressed by the accomplishments of her peers. But once the political appointees controlled the hiring, she said, ''The change in the quality of people who were chosen was very pronounced.''</p>
        <p>When the front office sent around the rÃ©sumÃ©s of those newly hired for the honors program, she said, ''It was obvious what they had: conservative and religious bona fides.''</p>
