        <p>A Nashville judge has ruled that Fisk University cannot sell artwork from its Stieglitz Collection, including Georgia O'Keeffe's signature painting ''Radiator Building-Night, New York.'' Tuesday's chancery court ruling came in a legal dispute over the university's right to sell the O'Keeffe and a painting by Marsden Hartley; both were donated by Ms. O'Keeffe in 1949. The university announced plans to sell the two paintings in late 2005 to bolster its endowment and pay for campus improvements.</p>
