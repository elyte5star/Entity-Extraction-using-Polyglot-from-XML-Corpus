        <p>Anne Midgette reviews rock musical Escape From Bellevue with music performed by Knockout Drops and narration by band's front man Christopher John Campion; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The rock musical has become the live-performance equivalent of the road movie: a ubiquitous convention turned rite of passage as one aspirant after another seeks to achieve its perfect fulfillment. If it falters -- which it often does -- it's less often on the ''rock'' than on the ''musical'' part. That is, a band drapes its songs over an often ambitious, and sometimes squirm-inducing, story.</p>
        <p>So ''Escape From Bellevue,'' which opened recently, offers a lesson in how to approach the genre, by leaving out the ''musical'' part pretty much entirely. The show, performed by the New York band the Knockout Drops, is not really a musical at all. (The band terms it a ''rock 'n' roll odyssey.'') But it does capitalize on the band's natural strengths: rock music of a solid, stick-to-your-ribs variety, and the gift of gab of the lead singer, Christopher John Campion, who narrates his life story in the manner of an agreeable stand-up comic. The resulting piece is basically a concert with expanded repartee between the songs.</p>

        <p>The rock musical has become the live-performance equivalent of the road movie: a ubiquitous convention turned rite of passage as one aspirant after another seeks to achieve its perfect fulfillment. If it falters -- which it often does -- it's less often on the ''rock'' than on the ''musical'' part. That is, a band drapes its songs over an often ambitious, and sometimes squirm-inducing, story.</p>
        <p>So ''Escape From Bellevue,'' which opened recently, offers a lesson in how to approach the genre, by leaving out the ''musical'' part pretty much entirely. The show, performed by the New York band the Knockout Drops, is not really a musical at all. (The band terms it a ''rock 'n' roll odyssey.'') But it does capitalize on the band's natural strengths: rock music of a solid, stick-to-your-ribs variety, and the gift of gab of the lead singer, Christopher John Campion, who narrates his life story in the manner of an agreeable stand-up comic. The resulting piece is basically a concert with expanded repartee between the songs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campion has rough-hewn features, a voice to match and a storyteller's knack for delineating character, which he mercifully does not try to extend into an attempt to play anyone other than himself. Without his ability for anecdote, there would be nothing to call a show at all.</p>
        <p>The plotline runs simply from heavy substance abuse to a couple of trips to Bellevue Hospital to a new, straightened-out life. With it ''Escape From Bellevue,'' an earlier version of which had a 13-week run in the East Village in 2005-6, has become the seed of a book (due in 2009), and represents a sometimes uneasy amalgam of personal journey and funky rock concert. There are often uncomfortable or trite moments at the joins between speech and song.</p>
        <p>The band itself is pretty good, doing the rock ''thing'' with loud relish and two drummers, showing its stuff best in numbers like ''Pilot Light,'' keeping shyly silent behind the piano accompaniment for the obligatory ballad, ''Bright Room.''</p>
        <p>All that the Knockout Drops seem to need is a touch of pizazz. And the very naturalness of ''Escape From Bellevue'' reveals its motivations: It is a band's creative attempt to showcase itself. The band may not be sure whether it wants to ride on the strength of its music or on Mr. Campion's own travails in creating it, but the group, and the generally enthusiastic audience, will take whatever it can get.</p>
        <p>''Escape From Bellevue'' runs Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at the Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-7171.</p>
