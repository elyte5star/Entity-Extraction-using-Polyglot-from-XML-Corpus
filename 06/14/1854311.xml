        <p>Dirk Westphal has elevated the status of the goldfish from pet to creature worthy of worship by putting its photo on, of all things, surfboards. Mr. Westphal, above left, a photographer and an avid surfer, makes the fully functional surfboards by hand in his Chinatown studio, where he photographs goldfish in tanks customized for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Most buyers treat the boards as decorative objects, Mr. Westphal said, hanging them on walls, as at right, or using them as room dividers. While they can be used for surfing, he doesn't recommend it. Considering the price -- $5,000 to $10,000 each -- and the damage that inevitably occurs during surfing, he said, ''you'd have to be insane to use one.''</p>
