        <p>Louis C. DeLuca, left, the State Senate minority leader, resigned yesterday from his leadership post, according to a statement from the Senate Republicans. Mr. DeLuca, Republican of Woodbury, pleaded guilty this month to a misdemeanor charge of asking a businessman now facing racketeering charges to have someone threaten a man Senator DeLuca believed was abusing a family member. The businessman, James Galante, a trash hauler, had not been charged at the time; he has since pleaded not guilty. In a statement, Senate Republicans said Senator John McKinney, of Fairfield, would assume the leadership role until the caucus elected a new leader. Senator DeLuca, 73, said he looked ''forward to continuing to be a productive member of our caucus.''</p>
