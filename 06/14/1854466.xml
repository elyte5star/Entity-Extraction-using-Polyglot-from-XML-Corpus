        <p>German officials heatedly protested remarks made by Representative Tom Lantos, a Democrat of California who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in which he described former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder as a ''political prostitute'' for taking a job with a Russian state gas company. The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, said the comment, made in a speech at the dedication ceremony for a victims of Communism memorial in Washington on Tuesday, was ''unseemly.'' The foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said it had breached the bounds of decorum and was a ''discredit'' to Mr. Lantos. Mr. Schröder has been criticized within Germany for his new job, overseeing a pipeline project.</p>
