        <p>Trucks that meet tougher emissions standards would pay just $7 rather than the $21 fee charged to other trucks to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan under a new provision of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan, the mayor said yesterday. He made the announcement at Gracie Mansion, surrounded by labor leaders who endorsed his overall environmental program, PlaNYC. Officials said that cleaner, more efficient trucks, as well as those retrofitted to reduce emissions by 85 percent, would qualify for the discounts. Mr. Bloomberg said that there were no plans to reduce the $8 automobile fee for lower-emission cars like hybrids because the program was intended both to reduce traffic and to raise revenue.</p>
