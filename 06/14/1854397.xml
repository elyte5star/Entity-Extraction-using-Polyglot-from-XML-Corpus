      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Canon's 8-megapixel S5 IS, which just went on sale, is considered a bridge camera -- crossing the gap between a pocket point-and-shoot and heftier single-lens reflex models, known as DSLRs. Those high-end cameras have interchangeable lenses, which can be costly and hard to change without dirt finding its way to the charged image sensor. The resulting spots on images can be a real problem.</p>
        <p>The S5 IS's all-purpose lens has a big zoom range -- 12X optical, allowing it to go from a wide 36 millimeters to an extremely long telephoto length, 432 millimeters, and with image stabilization to minimize shake. Like DSLRs, it has a hot shoe that lets you mount an external flash for advanced lighting control. But it gives up the DSLR's ability to see the world live through the lens. Instead it uses an electronic viewfinder -- a tiny screen -- inside the eyepiece instead. For dusty places and limited budgets, the trade-off can be a good deal.</p>

        <p>The camera, available from major retailers for $499, uses AA batteries that can be throwaways or rechargeable, making it attractive for on-the-road use. For maximum trip-documentation flexibility, frames of its 30 frames-per-second MPEG-1 video can be printed as still pictures.</p>
