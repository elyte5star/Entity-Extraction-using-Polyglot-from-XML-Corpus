        <p>A Staten Island man was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for scalding a 3-year-old boy in a bathtub in 2005, prosecutors said. The man, Michael Duhs, 34, of Seaview Avenue, was convicted of assault and child endangerment in State Supreme Court in February, said Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney. Mr. Donovan said Mr. Duhs was charged with scalding his live-in companion's son on Sept. 16, 2005, and not seeking medical attention for the child until the mother returned home six hours later. The boy suffered third-degree burns over 10 percent of his body, Mr. Donovan said.</p>
