        <p>The prosecutor in the Duke lacrosse case had nothing to do with a laboratory's decision to not say in a report that tests had found DNA from at least four unknown men on the body and underwear of a stripper who accused the students of gang rape, the lab director said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The testimony was given on the second day of an ethics trial of the prosecutor, Michael B. Nifong. Some of the most serious charges, which could result in Mr. Nifong's disbarment, involve a reported agreement between him and the lab director to exclude the DNA information from the report last year.</p>

        <p>The prosecutor in the Duke lacrosse case had nothing to do with a laboratory's decision to not say in a report that tests had found DNA from at least four unknown men on the body and underwear of a stripper who accused the students of gang rape, the lab director said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The testimony was given on the second day of an ethics trial of the prosecutor, Michael B. Nifong. Some of the most serious charges, which could result in Mr. Nifong's disbarment, involve a reported agreement between him and the lab director to exclude the DNA information from the report last year.</p>
        <p>Brian W. Meehan, director of the laboratory, DNA Security, said it was his decision alone not to refer to the unidentified male DNA in a report. Mr. Meehan, a witness for the state agency prosecuting the case, said Mr. Nifong had asked for a report on identifiable male DNA and did not limit what else he could write in the report.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Nifong never directed what should be in or out of the report,'' Mr. Meehan said, other than its main purpose of showing DNA matches to known males, such as a match with 98 percent certainty between one suspect and false fingernails found in the suspect's trashcan. The report also said no other DNA from the woman matched lacrosse players.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the three-member panel hearing the case, F. Lane Williamson, repeatedly pressed Mr. Meehan, asking whether the evidence of contact with at least four unidentified males would have been important in deciding the case if it had gone to trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meehan said he would have liked to have known more about it if he was a juror, adding that a rape could occur without DNA evidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meehan said that the report, in May 2006, was ''an interim report'' and that he planned to write a final report that contained all the DNA findings. He conceded that he had never before written an ''interim report'' on a case and that Mr. Nifong never asked for a final report.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Nifong, David Freedman, said he was pleased with Mr. Meehan's testimony. ''I thought it was fairly clear from the evidence there was no agreement, no attempt at all to hide the evidence in this case,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p>
        <p>Joseph Cheshire, a lawyer for one of the three ex-players who have been declared innocent, said Mr. Meehan lacked credibility and was trying to save his reputation.</p>
        <p>''There would never have been a 'final' report,'' Mr. Cheshire said. ''That's the whole problem here. They together conspired to withhold exculpatory evidence from the people who were charged.''</p>
