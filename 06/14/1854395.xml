        <p>The PC supports Windows Vista's Media Center software for recording and playing back live television as well as downloaded music and movies. The standard version comes with two video tuners, one for digital HD content and one for analog broadcast. The Hangar 18 can handle up to four tuners and record up to four channels at once.</p>
        <p>The Hangar 18 doesn't include an alien carcass, but it supports 802.11g and Bluetooth wireless and has a remote control that mimics the functions of a mouse when moved in three dimensions.</p>
