        <p>Yale University said yesterday that it was acquiring the Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven and Orange, about seven miles from its main campus in New Haven. Bayer announced in November that it was leaving the 136-acre site, where it conducted research and had its headquarters. When efforts to find another pharmaceutical company to take over the property failed, it was put up for auction. Yale was the winner, but declined to disclose the price. Richard C. Levin, Yale's president, said the acquisition would enable the university to accelerate its science research program.</p>
