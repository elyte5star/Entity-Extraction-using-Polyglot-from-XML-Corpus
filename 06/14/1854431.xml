        <p>T-Pain, the Florida soul singer whose obsessions include strippersand electronically processed, roboticvocals, has the best-selling album inthe country with ''Epiphany'' (Jive).Propelled by the hit song ''Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin'),'' the album is No. 1 on the Billboard chart, selling 171,000 copies last week, NielsenSoundScan reported. In a week of big new releases, Rihanna opened atNo. 2 with ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' (DefJam), which sold 162,000; Paul Mc-Cartney, with a new, Starbucks-affiliated record label -- and, naturally, heavy promotion at Starbucks stores -- reached No. 3 with ''Memory Almost Full'' (Hear Music). The country stars Big &amp; Rich bowed at No. 6 with ''Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace'' (Warner Brothers); Marilyn Manson reached No. 8 with Eat Me, Drink Me'' (Interscope); and the reggaetón star Daddy Yankee opened at No. 9 with ''El Cartel: The Big Boss'' (Interscope). Last week's No. 1, R. Kelly's ''Double Up'' Jive), fell to No. 4.</p>
