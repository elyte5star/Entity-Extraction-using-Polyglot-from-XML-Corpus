The article also left an incorrect impression in some copies that John Rowe, the chief executive of the Exelon Corporation, an electric utility company that operates nuclear power plants, was connected to those advertisements. The article noted that Mr. Rowe, ''coincidentally or not,'' is a co-founder of the Energy Security Leadership Council.'' In fact, he is the head of the National Commission on Energy Policy.</p>
