Josephy. Mother of Dan W. Sullivan. Born in Newark, NJ on March 31, 1953; daughter of Catherine Zizza Sullivan of West Long Branch, NJ and the Daniel Sullivan; daughterin-law of Joyce White Josephy of West Haven, CT. Amy loved to spend long hours working in her garden, and took a special pleasure in visiting the seaside where she grew up in New Jersey.

Her life was a beautiful one, and her memory will live forever in the hearts and minds of the many people who have been touched by her love. Private services with a memorial to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, 305 Great Neck Rd., Waterford, CT 06485 or the Father Michael J.
