        <p>For six months or so, Ed Jew, a new member of San Francisco Board of Supervisors, has spoken on all sorts of issues involving this city. He has spoken about San Francisco laws, San Francisco people and even San Francisco animals.</p>
        <p>There is one small problem, the authorities say. Mr. Jew does not live in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Jew, a florist and real estate investor, surrendered after being charged with nine felonies, including perjury, filing false documents and election code violations. In keeping with the geographic mystery, Mr. Jew surrendered in Burlingame, 18 miles southeast of here, where the authorities theorize he lives.</p>
        <p>According to charges filed Tuesday by the San Francisco district attorney's office, Mr. Jew posed as a resident of the often fogbound Sunset District along the Pacific. Mr. Jew has said he does live there in his father's house, despite skeptical neighbors and utility records that the district attorney's office says show sporadic use. The city attorney is also investing whether he meets residency requirements.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Jew, Steven F. Gruel, said that his client denied the charges and that he did not use much water at home because he showered at his florist store. Mr. Gruel said Mr. Jew surrendered in Burlingame because it was more convenient. Questions about the residency began last month after the F.B.I., in a bribery inquiry, searched Mr. Jew's store, city office and listed residence.</p>
        <p>None of which seemed to bode well for Mr. Jew, a surprise winner in an election in the fall who has made small waves by opposing bans on plastic bags in grocery stores and feeding wild parrots in a downtown park. The bans passed anyway.</p>
        <p>The board president, Aaron Peskin, said although Mr. Jew was presumed to be innocent, ''his continued presence on the board is eroding San Franciscans' confidence in their government.''</p>
        <p>''I hope,'' Mr. Peskin said, ''he'll do the honorable thing and move on.''</p>
        <p>For one day, at least, Mr. Jew seemed to have done that. An aide in his office said the supervisor was ''down the Peninsula'' on Wednesday, visiting his extended family. But, she said, he will be back here for board business on Thursday.</p>
