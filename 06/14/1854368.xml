        <p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair seems determined to use his final weeks in office to show how far he has strayed from the pledges of clean government that helped sweep him to power a decade ago. Defending his decision to block a corruption investigation into the sale of fighter jets and other weapons to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Blair said last week that the probe would have led nowhere except to the ''complete wreckage'' of a vital strategic relationship.</p>
        <p>That glib dismissal ignores the crucial point: bribery is never justified, smart or legal. So says the O.E.C.D. Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, by which Britain is legally bound.</p>
        <p>The case revolves around allegations that BAE Systems, Britain's largest defense contractor, paid bribes to secure a 20-year deal to sell Tornado fighters and other weapons to Saudi Arabia. Last December, Mr. Blair halted an investigation into the matter on grounds of national security. The Saudis were apparently threatening to cut off the deal, as well as intelligence about terrorist activities.</p>
        <p>Then, earlier this month the BBC and The Guardian newspaper reported that over the years, BAE had paid millions of pounds into accounts controlled by Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan, a highly influential former ambassador to Washington and top foreign policy adviser to the Saudi king. Prince Bandar and BAE have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Perhaps there was none, and perhaps the Saudis leaned on Mr. Blair only because they didn't want British investigators rummaging in their bank accounts. The House of Saud regards the kingdom as personal property, making it hard to distinguish between a legitimate payment to the state treasury and a bribe to one of the 200-odd royal princes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair ought to understand, even if the princes don't, that avoiding embarrassment to powerful friends and allies is not a legitimate reason to quash a corruption investigation. All that does is increase suspicion, and send the wrong message to any other princes or government leaders who think that a wink and an envelope is the only way to conduct international business.</p>
