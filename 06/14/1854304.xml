        <p>GARDENERS are as opinionated about gloves as they are about, say, whether pachysandra is good ground cover or a rampaging eyesore. Some swear by the cheapest throwaways; others have a beloved leather pair, improved, like a baseball mitt, through use. In any event, gardening gloves are as essential as a good trowel, protecting the hands against cuts (keep your tetanus shot up to date) and the blistering work of hoeing, shoveling and pushing a wheelbarrow uphill.</p>
        <p>And work it is. Gardening requires mild to moderate physical activity, and in summer, sweaty gardeners appreciate an afternoon shower as much as the tomatoes do. Some glove makers recognize this and incorporate features to increase breathability. Katherine Whiteside, the author of ''The Way We Garden Now,'' tested six pairs of gloves while building a raised-bed potager. She cautioned that ''no one pair of gloves is going to do the myriad of different tasks there are to do in the garden.'' That said, a pair of disposable latex gloves did not make the cut: ''Not one redeeming feature,'' she said.</p>
