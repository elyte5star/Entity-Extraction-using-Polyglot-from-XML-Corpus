        <p>The Ipevo Free.2 phone is slim, sleek and potentially sneaky. The phone, which makes calls over the Internet, can record your calls and save them on the hard drive of your computer.</p>
        <p>The phone, $45 at www.ipevo.com, has other features that are equally neat, though less sly. The handset has separate hot buttons for making free calls on the Skype calling service to other Skype users, and for Skype Out calls to regular phones, which incur a charge.</p>

        <p>The Ipevo Free.2 phone is slim, sleek and potentially sneaky. The phone, which makes calls over the Internet, can record your calls and save them on the hard drive of your computer.</p>
        <p>The phone, $45 at www.ipevo.com, has other features that are equally neat, though less sly. The handset has separate hot buttons for making free calls on the Skype calling service to other Skype users, and for Skype Out calls to regular phones, which incur a charge.</p>
        <p>A toggle button speeds scrolling through past calls and current contacts. And there is a mute button -- critical to any recording device.</p>
        <p>Recordings made with the phone can be saved in MP3 and other formats, although the record feature currently works only with a PC using Windows XP or higher. The phone features work with PC or Macintosh, provided your Mac has OS X 10.4 or higher.</p>
        <p>Of course, secretly recording calls is illegal in many states, which the Free.2 addresses by posting a warning on the screen of the other person's computer (or inserting an occasional beep on calls to phones), alerting people that they are being recorded. And that little click you might hear? That just means your friend hung up.</p>
