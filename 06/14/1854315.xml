        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) PIRATE MASTER -- It's never easy at the top -- of the mast, that is. Capt. Joe Don, left, is riding high for the moment, but in this reality TV jibe at ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' there are plenty of buccaneers who are ready to throw him over. In a high-seas version of a straw poll, half the pirate contestants are backing the captain, while the others are ready for a mutiny. They'll have to find the $35,000 bounty first.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Travel) THE KIDS ARE IN CHARGE: FAMILY VACATION -- In the original (Swiss) Family Robinson trip, the characters ended up dumped on a deserted island, living in a tree house and aiming to survive. When the Robinson family of this episode traverses the Pacific to the islands of Hawaii, the accomodations will be less primitive, but with the kids calling the shots the trip should be just as adventurous.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) FAST CARS &amp; SUPERSTARS: THE GILLETTE YOUNG GUNS CELEBRITY RACE -- Serena Williams has already been sent home; which celebrity race-car driver will follow? The volleyball player Gabrielle Reece pulls out an incredible save, and the actor William Shatner steps up his game this week, but only time will tell if that will keep them in the competition.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Discovery Health) PARENTING A BAKER'S DOZEN -- The Brady bunch has nothing on the Healys: The family brings together six kids from a previous marriage, another single child and three sets of twins, making 13 their lucky number. The special is part of Discovery Health's Baby Week.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (AMC) ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ -- Escaping from Alcatraz prison, which is surrounded by the dangerous waters of San Francisco Bay, was unthinkable. But just over 45 years ago, on June 11, 1962, the inmates Frank Morris and the brothers John and Clarence Anglin made it through the walls and into urban lore. Whether the trio survived or drowned is still a mystery. If you believe this 1979 movie starring Clint Eastwood, above, as Mr. Morris, annoying the warden may have been as much of a motivation for the escape as gaining their freedom.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (NBC) STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP -- In the second half of this episode, the medical situation of Jordan (Amanda Peet) becomes even more serious and Simon (D. L. Hughley) loses his temper with the press. Flashbacks tell the story of how Danny (Bradley Whitford) and Matt (Matthew Perry) lost their jobs in the first place.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Travel) 1,000 PLACES TO SEE BEFORE YOU DIE -- No, it's not ''The Apprentice,'' but tonight the Ulles will be swimming with the sharks -- as well as riding elephants and discovering Cape Town -- as they explore South Africa.</p>
