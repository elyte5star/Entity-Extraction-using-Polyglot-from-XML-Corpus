        <p>Apple rarely makes sweeping changes to its product line, which is why its new MacBook Pro laptops look identical to older models. Only the innards are different, offering improved wireless networking and processing speed.</p>
        <p>The 17-inch model, shown here, now includes a 2.4-gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo processor along with up to 4 gigabytes of RAM. The battery lasts more than 5 hours on one charge, and it includes high-speed 802.11n wireless support and Bluetooth.</p>

        <p>The standard 17-inch model with 160-gigabyte hard drive and DVD burner costs $2,799 at Apple's online store. It has two Firewire ports, three U.S.B. ports and an ExpressCard slot for expansion. A high-resolution 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen and a 250-gigabyte hard drive are available.</p>
        <p>The 15-inch model, which starts at $1,999, now has an energy-efficient L.E.D. backlit screen, an improvement over fluorescent lighting. The 15-inch version tops out at 2.4 gigahertz and can have up to 160 gigabytes of hard drive space.</p>
        <p>Both new MacBook Pros also have an Nvidia GeForce 8600M GT graphics processor.</p>
