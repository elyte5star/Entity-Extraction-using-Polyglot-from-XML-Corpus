        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, yesterday awarded the writer and former dissident Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, right, Russia's top honor for a lifetime of humanitarian achievements, the Kremlin press service reported. Author of ''The Gulag Archipelago'' and other incendiary attacks against the Soviet government, the 88-year-old Nobel Prize winner spent two decades in exile before returning to Russia in 1994. Mr. Solzhenitsyn has since lived a reclusive life in Moscow, publishing several works, including a large book on Russian-Jewish relations. His wife, Natalia, told the Interfax news agency that her husband viewed the award as ''an expression of his life's work.'' ''It gives hope that this country will learn from the lesson of self-destruction in the 20th century and will not repeat it again,'' she said.</p>
