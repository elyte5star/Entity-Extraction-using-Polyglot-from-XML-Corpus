        <p>Hoping to head off a takeover by Rupert Murdoch, the main union of the Dow Jones &amp; Company employees is shopping around for another bidder and has begun talks with aides to Ronald W. Burkle, a California billionaire, union officials and others said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Independent Association of Publishers' Employees and its financial advisers, Ownership Associates, made contact a few days ago with Mr. Burkle's private equity firm, the Yucaipa Companies, and people on both sides say Mr. Burkle is eager to help the union find an alternative buyer. But they say that so far, Mr. Burkle has not signaled whether he is actually interested in trying to buy Dow Jones himself.</p>
        <p>Last year, Yucaipa was in the running to buy a dozen Knight Ridder newspapers, and Mr. Burkle joined with the real estate investor Eli Broad in making an offer for the Tribune Company, but neither bid was successful. Mr. Burkle, a well-known Democratic fund-raiser, and Yucaipa are known for advising unions on business deals and making joint bids with unions.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, stated for the first time that it was willing to talk to buyers, in effect agreeing to meet with Mr. Murdoch, while simultaneously inviting competing bids. That prompted the union to reach out to Ownership Associates.</p>
        <p>''We gave them the job of putting together a counteroffer,'' said Steven Yount, president of the union, which represents 2,000 Dow Jones employees. ''They started by contacting a number of big potential partners, and Ron Burkle was the first to say yes, he would be interested in working with us to put together a bid.''</p>
        <p>While industry analysts and investment bankers have floated a number of names of potential buyers -- General Electric, the Washington Post Company, Bloomberg -- none have stepped forward. They may see Mr. Murdoch's $5 billion offer, which is a 65 percent premium over where the stock closed April 30, the day before his bid became public, as simply too rich to match or beat.</p>
        <p>The disclosure of the union's search for another suitor came a day after the first meeting between Mr. Murdoch and his News Corporation and a delegation from the Bancroft family, owners of a controlling interest in Dow Jones; other Dow Jones officials; and their advisers.</p>
        <p>Many members of the family are reluctant to sell to Mr. Murdoch, who they fear would cheapen and compromise the journalism of their crown jewel, The Wall Street Journal, and they want to devise a system that would allow him to buy the company but not exercise editorial control over The Journal. They plan to ask for more than the $60 a share Mr. Murdoch has offered, but the issue of money was never raised in Monday's four-hour meeting; the family and its advisers say governance of The Journal is the primary issue.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, people in both camps said that no follow-up meeting between Mr. Murdoch and the Bancrofts had been scheduled, but they said that it might not be necessary because negotiations could continue through intermediaries.</p>
