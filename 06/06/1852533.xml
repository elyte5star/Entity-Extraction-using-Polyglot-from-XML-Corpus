        <p>The abusive interrogation methods reverse-engineered from the military's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape torture-resistance program cause enormous psychological harm ranging from psychosis and suicidal ideation to post-traumatic stress disorder.

        <p>Re ''Advisers Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation'' (front page, May 30):</p>
        <p>The abusive interrogation methods reverse-engineered from the military's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape torture-resistance program cause enormous psychological harm ranging from psychosis and suicidal ideation to post-traumatic stress disorder. They are not only unreliable and immoral; they constitute torture and violate the United States' commitment to respect the most basic human rights.</p>
        <p>Yet according to the Pentagon's inspector general, psychologists, under the guise of behavioral science, have used their credentials to develop and carry out these highly abusive techniques at Guant√°namo, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The abuses are a direct result of trying to rely on science and scientists to break down detainees.</p>
        <p>The only appropriate response, for the profession and for the government, is to end the direct participation of psychologists, who have an ethical obligation to minimize harm, in interrogations.</p>
