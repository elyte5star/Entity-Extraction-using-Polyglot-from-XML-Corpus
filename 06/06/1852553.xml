        <p>A 50-foot-high retaining wall behind a large hilltop house owned by a high-profile Staten Island lawyer collapsed late Monday night, unleashing an avalanche of concrete blocks weighing hundreds of pounds each into the yards of smaller homes below.</p>
        <p>A car and a home at the base of the hill were damaged and people in four houses were evacuated, but no one was hurt, the Buildings Department said.</p>
        <p>The owner of the wall, John M. D'Amato, is a lobbying partner of the former Staten Island borough president Guy V. Molinari and is also the New York City chairman of Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato had erected the 200-foot-long wall without a permit, buildings officials said. He eventually obtained one, but the wall was never inspected by the city, only by Mr. D'Amato's own engineer, who at the time was on probation by state officials for gross negligence, records show.</p>
        <p>A 50-foot-long section of the wall, behind 96 Overlook Avenue on Emerson Hill, collapsed just before midnight, after a day of torrential rain, and sent people fleeing from their homes at the base of the hill on Richmond Road.</p>
        <p>''I heard a big impact, like an earthquake,'' said Walid Awadeh, the owner of Diddle Dee Deli, across Richmond Road from the affected houses. ''I saw dust coming out of the cliff and we saw rocks coming down. We ran across the street and asked if everyone was O.K. There were people outside in their pajamas.''</p>
        <p>Retaining walls built on private property have long occupied a gray area in the city's inspection and enforcement systems. The collapse of an apartment complex's 75-foot-high wall onto the Henry Hudson Parkway in 2005 called attention to the existence of more than 100 such privately owned walls in the city, none of them subject to regular city inspection and many of them badly deteriorated.</p>
        <p>There is still no law requiring that privately owned retaining walls be periodically inspected.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in the driveway of one home at the bottom of the hill, a white sport utility vehicle stood with its windshield smashed and its hood badly dented. The Buildings Department said that a deck, a fence and a swimming pool of another home were damaged. Trees lay uprooted in backyards amid scattered rectangular concrete blocks more than two feet wide.</p>
        <p>The Buildings Department issued Mr. D'Amato a violation yesterday and was investigating whether the engineer's inspection complied with the law, said Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the department.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato did not return phone calls seeking comment yesterday, nor did the engineer, Gaspare Santoro.</p>
        <p>All day long, men in hard hats swarmed over the hill between Mr. D'Amato's house and the homes below, apparently testing the stability of the remaining sections of the wall. Chunks of dirt periodically tumbled down the hill. Residents on Richmond Road were allowed to return to their homes only to grab a few belongings.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's house, a four-story brick colonial with a lushly landscaped yard and gracefully curving stairs down to a grand front entrance, has come to the city's attention several times since he began construction several years ago. In 2002, the Buildings Department received a complaint that he had raised the yard 30 feet without a permit, records show.</p>
        <p>The same year, buildings officials said, Mr. D'Amato was cited for building the wall without a permit and paid a $250 fine. He later filed an application to legalize the completed wall, and in 2006, his engineer, Mr. Santoro, signed off on the inspection of it, the department said.</p>
        <p>In November 2004, records show, the state suspended Mr. Santoro's engineering license for two years for ''grossly negligent failure to comply with a substantial provision of local laws governing the practice of the profession of architecture.'' The suspension was stayed and modified to probation, so Mr. Santoro was authorized to inspect the wall in 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santoro is working on a plan to stabilize the wall, and the Buildings Department will expedite its review of the plan, Ms. Lindquist said.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's home has also attracted attention at the state level, of a different sort. In 2006, Mr. D'Amato held a $2,500-a-plate fund-raiser there for Eliot Spitzer's campaign for governor.</p>
        <p>Across Overlook Avenue from the house yesterday, a neighbor, Celio Balacich, said he was not sure what to make of the collapse. ''It's a freak accident,'' he said. ''It's the rain. But maybe it was poor construction.''</p>
