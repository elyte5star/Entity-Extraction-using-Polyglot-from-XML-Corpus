        <p>Michelin has seen competitors come and go, but none have built the reputation of Gilles Pudlowski, whose Pudlo Paris guide has been published by Little Bookroom in English for the first time and will go on sale in the United States next week for $19.95. Mr. Pudlowski's authority, expressed as ''we'' because it represents a team of reviewers, is taken seriously by Parisians. Listings of about 1,000 restaurants, bakeries, bars, cafes and tea rooms are organized according to arrondissement. The front of the book, now in its 17th edition, highlights the best of the best, giving recognition this year to Hier et Aujourd'hui as best value, for its 26-euro menu. Hélène Darroze is chef of the year; her namesake restaurant receives three plates, the top rating.</p>
