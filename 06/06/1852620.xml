        <p>State officials yesterday released preliminary crime statistics for 2006, reporting a modest decrease in the crime rate over 2005. Violent crime decreased by 4.6 percent in New York City and 2.3 percent in the rest of the state; nationwide, according to federal statistics released this week, the rate of violent crime increased slightly.
