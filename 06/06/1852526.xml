        <p>At the Billboard Music Awards in 2002, Cher had a salty rejoinder to critics who ''have been telling me I'm on the way out every year.''

It's hard to believe these comments threaten the nation's well-being, but the Federal Communications Commission found them indecent and profane.

        <p>At the Billboard Music Awards in 2002, Cher had a salty rejoinder to critics who ''have been telling me I'm on the way out every year.'' At the same event in 2003, Nicole Richie had some earthy reflections on the difficulties of cleaning a Prada purse. It's hard to believe these comments threaten the nation's well-being, but the Federal Communications Commission found them indecent and profane. That threatened Fox Broadcasting, which televised the awards show, with major fines. This week, in a very welcome decision, a federal appeals court overturned the F.C.C.'s indecency policy.</p>
        <p>For years, the F.C.C. had a reasonable, practical approach to live broadcasts. It recognized that coarse language sometimes slips in and if the offensive words were relatively isolated events, stations could carry them without fear of punishment. But in recent years, the F.C.C. decided to go after broadcasters that carry programs with even ''fleeting expletives,'' like Cher's and Ms. Richie's.</p>
        <p>In a suit brought by a group of broadcasters, the New York-based United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found the commission's policy to be arbitrary and capricious and the reasoning behind it to be weak and riddled with illogic. One of the commission's rationales was that the expletives could not be separated from their ''sexual or excretory'' meaning. But the court noted that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have both used the words the commission objected to in public in ways that clearly did not have any ''sexual or excretory'' meaning.</p>
        <p>The Second Circuit did not need to reach the constitutional issues in the case. But it rightly pointed out that the F.C.C.'s ''fleeting expletives'' policy also raises serious First Amendment concerns. That suggests that even if the commission tried to improve its reasoning, the policy would still be struck down. The F.C.C. should return to the more reasonable approach it once took to regulating live broadcasts and focus on more important issues than Cher's and Ms. Richie's colorful language.</p>
