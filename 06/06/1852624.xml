        <p>About two miles of beaches, from Deal south to Bradley Beach, were closed yesterday after a pipe broke at the Asbury Park sewage treatment plant, Monmouth County officials said. Beaches in Allenhurst, Loch Arbour, Asbury Park and Ocean Grove were also closed. The pipe, which has since been repaired, released about half a million gallons of partly treated sewage into the Atlantic Ocean between 3:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. yesterday, said William Simmons, the county's environmental health coordinator. Results from water quality tests, expected this afternoon, will determine whether the beaches can reopen.</p>
