        <p>In Takeshi Furusawa's ''Ghost Train,'' a group of high school students tries to unravel a mystery that leads the teenagers into the bowels of their city, and into a nest of elements familiar from other Japanese supernatural horror movies.</p>
        <p>The film's heroine, a straitlaced class president named Nana (Erika Sawajiri, of ''Shinobi''), is entrusted with looking after her kid sister (Sayuri Honda) when their mom is hospitalized; the job becomes harder when the sister finds a briefcase at the train station she uses to commute to school, then vanishes.</p>
        <p>Nana teams up with her classmate Kanae (Chinatsu Wakatsuki), who has found a mysterious bracelet and has been plagued by visions of a dark female figure ever since, and a train conductor named Shunichi (Shun Oguri), who has seen a similar figure on the tracks and even halted his trains because of it.</p>
        <p>''Ghost Train'' moves along elegantly. The characters are likable (if shallowly acted). And Mr. Furusawa's lovely compositions use architectural lines to carve up screen space and isolate his players.</p>
        <p>But the movie ultimately proves more unnerving than terrifying, and the monster, which probably shouldn't have been revealed in quite so much detail, looks too much like the title character of ''Bride of Chucky,'' only with eyes in the back of her mossy head.</p>
        <p>Ghost Train  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Directed by Takeshi Furusawa; written (in Japanese, with English subtitles) by Mr. Furusawa and Erika Tanaka; director of photography, Tomoyuki Mizuguchi; edited by Masahiro Onaga and Isao Kawase; music by Yusuke Hayashi; produced by Yashitaka Ishizuka and Nozomu Enoki; released by ADV Films. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 93 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Erika Sawajiri (Nana), Chinatsu Wakatsuki (Kanae), Shun Oguri (Shunichi) and Sayuri Honda (Noriko).</p>
