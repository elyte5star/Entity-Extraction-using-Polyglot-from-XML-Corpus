        <p>Vadim Ponorovsky, the owner of Paradou, a bistro in the meatpacking district, and Paradou Marché, a crepe and sandwich counter in the Essex Street Market, has opened Casa Tua in the market, specializing in freshly made ravioli and other pastas, and sauces. David Shemesh, the chef, may encourage you to try his beet and goat cheese ravioli -- he's making it at right -- or his seven-herb fettuccine. And in a spirit of adventure, you might consider his earthy sumac fettuccine, flavored Middle Eastern style, and toss it with olives, olive oil, lemon zest and chilies. Pasta with sauce at cafe tables is $8 to $10, from 11:30 a.m. until the market closes (at 6 p.m. Monday to Wednesday, and 7 p.m. Thursday to Saturday). Pasta for two, to take home, is $6.50 to $14, and sauces are $3.50: 120 Essex Street (Delancey Street), (212) 477-4177.</p>
