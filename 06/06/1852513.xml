        <p>In a defeat for Mexico's television duopoly, the Supreme Court struck down crucial provisions of a media law on Tuesday, sending a clear message in favor of greater economic competition.</p>
        <p>The media law was passed last year in the heat of a fiercely fought election campaign. Critics said that it amounted to a giveaway to Mexico's two television companies, Televisa and TV Azteca, which lobbied for the new law.</p>
        <p>But with the government of President Felipe Calderón pushing for greater competition in many industries, the law reached the court as the political climate was changing.</p>
        <p>In the last four weeks, the Supreme Court has opened its deliberations in an unprecedented way, hearing testimony from opponents and defenders of the law.</p>
        <p>Since it began public deliberations on the disputed clauses of the law last week, nearly all of its decisions have gone against the TV companies.</p>
        <p>Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language media company, and TV Azteca control more than 90 percent of the broadcast television industry between them. Their support for the law caused it to be called the Televisa Law.</p>
        <p>Many other industries in Mexico, including telecommunications, cement, beer and soft drinks, and pharmaceutical distribution are controlled by one or two companies.</p>
        <p>''This really does imply a much more adverse environment for monopolies,'' said César Hernández, a legal expert at the Center of Research for Development, a Mexico City research group.</p>
        <p>In one of its final decisions in the matter, the court on Tuesday struck down a provision that would have allowed Televisa and TV Azteca to use the spectrum freed up by switching to digital broadcasting to offer telephone or Internet services without paying for a license.</p>
        <p>A Televisa spokesman said the company had no comment. A TV Azteca spokesman did not respond to a message.</p>
        <p>The court also rejected a clause that would have granted new television concessions to the highest bidder. Supporters argued that the law would end the presidential discretion that has prevailed until now in granting television concessions.</p>
        <p>Over the last couple of months, legislators and others who voted for the law seemed to perform a collective mea culpa, acknowledging that they had voted for passage because they feared negative television coverage during an election campaign.</p>
        <p>The TV companies ''trampled on all the political leaders and this is the backlash,'' Mr. Hernández said.</p>
        <p>During the deliberations, the court rejected the law's automatic renewal of broadcast licenses after 20 years. The court also gave new authority to the Federal Competition Commission, which has struggled to rein in monopoly power.</p>
        <p>The court strengthened the president's ability to appoint members of the Federal Telecommunications Commission, which is perceived to be too close to the industry. The decision may clear the way for Mr. Calderón to appoint two pro-competition commissioners who were rejected last year by the Senate.</p>
