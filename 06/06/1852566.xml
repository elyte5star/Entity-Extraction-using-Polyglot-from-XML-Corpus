        <p>An article in Business Day on May 3 about an I.B.M. advance in chip-making referred imprecisely to recent developments in the field. I.B.M. and Intel -- not Intel alone -- announced in January that they would take advantage of a new insulating material for their chips. (It is I.B.M.'s more recent work, involving a manufacturing process that creates insulating vacuum channels in chips, that sets it apart from Intel's approach.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on May 4; this correction was delayed for research.</p>
