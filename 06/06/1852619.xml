        <p>The hotelier André Balazs bought Maison Tropicale, a small 1951 aluminum-paneled house by the French designer Jean Prouvé, for $4.97 million yesterday, Christie's auction house said. Christie's had estimated that the house would go for $4 million to $6 million. (The final price includes Christie's commission: 20 percent of the first $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest.) The house had been on view since mid-May in Long Island City. Prouvé designed it as a prototype for prefabricated homes for French colonial officials stationed in Africa. The seller, Eric Touchaleaume, a French antiques dealer, has said he plans to use the proceeds to finance a Prouvé museum that will travel in another Maison Tropicale.</p>
