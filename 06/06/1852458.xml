        <p>8 P.M. (13) WE LOVE ELLA! A TRIBUTE TO THE FIRST LADY OF SONG ''Great Performances'' salutes Ella Fitzgerald, left, in honor of what would have been her 90th birthday (April 25) in this concert special taped at the Galen Center of the University of Southern California. Patti Austin, Natalie Cole, K. D. Lang, Nancy Wilson, Wynonna Judd, Stevie Wonder and Ruben Studdard, among others, perform Fitzgerald favorites. Quincy Jones and Ms. Cole are hosts of this 90-minute special, which includes interviews, a slide show and never-before-released vocal tracks.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (TLC) WAR WOUNDS: HOME AND STILL FIGHTING Four Iraq veterans cope with injuries ranging from facial wounds to amputations.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (BBC America) FOOTBALLERS' WIVES A new season begins in this salacious tribute to soccer wives and the players they love, or at least love to hate. And that means a trip to the beauty salon, where the women get gussied up in preparation for sporting events both on and off the field. But Tanya (Zoë Lucker), Amber (Laila Rouass) and Shannon (Sarah Barrand) are about to face a little competition: Liberty Baker (Phina Oruche), a top model. Joan Collins will join the cast later in the season as Eva de Wolffe, a powerful magazine editor with a stony heart and razor-sharp claws.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) AMERICAN INVENTOR Aspiring widget makers put their inventions on the line in this competition's second season. The prize: $1 million, and the possibility of turning an idea into a marketable product. The imaginative judges: George Foreman of grill fame; Peter Jones, a British businessman and the creator of the series with Simon Cowell; Pat Croce, a physical therapist turned owner of the Philadelphia 76ers; and Sara Blakely, who developed the body-shaper line Spanx. Tonight amateur inventors unveil their wares at casting calls in Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TBS) TYLER PERRY'S HOUSE OF PAYNE Mr. Perry is the writer, director and executive producer of this new comedy series, about three generations of a family forced to live under one roof. LaVan Davis plays Curtis Payne, an Atlanta firefighter who believes that his wife, Ella (Cassi Davis), is his queen and that his home is his castle -- but who has to share his castle with a few jesters, including his son, Calvin (Lance Gross); his nephew C. J. (Allen Payne); C. J.'s wife, Janine (Demetria McKinney); and their children, Malik (Larramie Doc Shaw) and Jazmine (China Anne McClain). Mr. Perry makes an appearance in tonight's episode as his mad black woman, Madea, alongside Keke Palmer (''Akeelah and the Bee'').</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Sci Fi) DESTINATION TRUTH Josh Gates, right, a self-proclaimed ''truth seeker,'' travels the globe in search of the so-called supernatural, and tries to get to the bottom of things. First stop: Papua New Guinea, where he investigates the legend of a mermaid and a reptilian beast.</p>
