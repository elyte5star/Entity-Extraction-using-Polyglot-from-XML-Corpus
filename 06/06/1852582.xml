        <p>Fans of horror may be interested in ''Devil's Trade,'' an original serial that has its premieres tomorrow on FEARnet, a Web site and on-demand television service devoted to tales of gore and suspense. The story, about three teenagers plagued by a curse, will be told in seven three-to-five minute weekly episodes. ''Devil's Trade'' is produced by Ghost House Pictures, which was formed by the filmmakers Sam Raimi and Robert G. Tapert, in partnership with Mandate Pictures. The film is one of two that Ghost House will produce for FEARnet, a joint venture of Comcast, Sony Pictures Television and Lionsgate that began last Halloween.</p>
