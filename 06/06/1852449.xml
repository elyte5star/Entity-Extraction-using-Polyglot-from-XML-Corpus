        <p>RHUBARB is an alarmingly sour vegetable passed off as a fruit, but requiring a huge mound of sugar to effect the transformation.</p>
        <p>Crumb cake is a huge mound of sugar disguised as a cake, but demanding a bracing counterpoint -- say a swallow of coffee or tea -- to allay its cloying sweetness.</p>
        <p>These two truths coexisted in my mind without overlapping until I bit into a piece of crumb cake so texturally perfect (soft sliver of cake topped by a deep layer of grape-size crumbs), yet so toothachingly sweet that the only antidote was sucking on the lemon in my seltzer.</p>
        <p>The sourness of the lemon immediately made me think about the rhubarb I had in the fridge. It occurred to me that, instead of cutting its tartness with a mountain of sugar, why not mix the rhubarb into a crumb cake to cut the cake's sweetness?</p>
        <p>It was an ''Aha!'' moment, as when some forebear first paired caviar with Champagne. Or when peanut butter met jelly.</p>
        <p>A little crumb cake background is in order. I've spent a good part of my adult life actively pursuing the perfect crumb cake recipe: a high ratio of meltingly tender crumbs to buttery, velvety cake. But that requires a lot of sugar, and I was determined to find a formula that had the crumb without the cloy. Did the rhubarb epiphany mean that perfection was within my grasp?</p>
        <p>I added cubed rhubarb to the cake batter, and covered it all with giant crumbs using a technique lifted from Cook's Illustrated magazine. It calls for making a homogenous brown sugar dough, then pinching off marbles to form crumbs. It's slightly more time-consuming than the usual streusel-making method of pulsing the ingredients in a food processor and dumping them on the batter, but when it comes to a magnificent crumb cake, I'm happy to put in 10 extra minutes.</p>
        <p>But the cake was still cloying. The rhubarb had become acidic puddles of pulp: no peanut butter-and-jelly harmony.</p>
        <p>So I contemplated all the successful rhubarb desserts I'd ever had until I hit upon a rhubarb crisp made by Claudia Fleming when she was at Gramercy Tavern. (Disclosure: I wrote a cookbook with her).</p>
        <p>I remembered her saying that tossing the rhubarb in just a bit of sugar encourages the sturdy stems to absorb the syrup that forms. It was exactly what I needed my rhubarb to do. Though I was loath to add more sugar to a recipe that was already overloaded, I did it anyway.</p>
        <p>When rhubarb crumb cake No. 2 cooled, I dug in. The rhubarb was mellow and gently sweet, with still enough zesty bite to offset the sugary cake. At last I had crumb cake fulfillment. Which just goes to show: when less isn't more, try adding more.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb 'Big Crumb' Coffeecake  Time: 11/2 hours, plus cooling</p>
        <p>Butter for greasing pan  For the rhubarb filling:  1/2 pound rhubarb, trimmed  1/4 cup sugar  2 teaspoons cornstarch  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</p>
        <p>For the crumbs:  1/3 cup dark brown sugar  1/3 cup granulated sugar  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  1/8 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup melted butter  13/4 cups cake flour</p>
        <p>For the cake:  1/3 cup sour cream  1 large egg  1 large egg yolk  2 teaspoons vanilla extract  1 cup cake flour  1/2 cup sugar  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon baking powder  1/4 teaspoon salt  6 tablespoons softened butter, cut into 8 pieces.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease an 8-inch-square baking pan. For filling, slice rhubarb 1/2 inch thick and toss with sugar, cornstarch and ginger. Set aside.  2. To make crumbs, in a large bowl, whisk together sugars, spices, salt and butter until smooth. Stir in flour with a spatula. It will look like a solid dough.  3. To prepare cake, in a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, egg, egg yolk and vanilla. Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add butter and a spoonful of sour cream mixture and mix on medium speed until flour is moistened. Increase speed and beat for 30 seconds. Add remaining sour cream mixture in two batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition, and scraping down the sides of bowl with a spatula. Scoop out about 1/2 cup batter and set aside.  4. Scrape remaining batter into prepared pan. Spoon rhubarb over batter. Dollop set-aside batter over rhubarb; it does not have to be even.  5. Using your fingers, break topping mixture into big crumbs, about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch in size. They do not have to be uniform, but make sure most are around that size. Sprinkle over cake. Bake cake until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean of batter (it might be moist from rhubarb), 45 to 55 minutes. Cool completely before serving.  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
