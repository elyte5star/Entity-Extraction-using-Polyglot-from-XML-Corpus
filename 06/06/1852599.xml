        <p>The health minister, long known for questioning the scientific tenets of the AIDS epidemic, has turned down an invitation to address the nation's third annual conference on the disease because she was not given a conspicuous spot on the conference agenda, Vice President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said. The minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, was excluded from opening ceremonies at the conference, in Durban, but had been scheduled to speak today at a gathering of AIDS experts and activists. Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, who did speak at the opening session, criticized the event's organizers for relegating Dr. Tshabalala-Msimang to a lesser spot on the program. The health minister's speech was to mark her return to public life after a long illness culminating early this year in a liver transplant.</p>
