        <p>The Afghan Defense Ministry said Tuesday that a boat full of fleeing Taliban fighters had been fired upon by NATO helicopters and sunk in the Helmand River, in southern Afghanistan. All on board, between 20 and 30 guerrillas, drowned, said Gen. Zaher Azimi, a ministry spokesman.</p>
        <p>It was the second sinking on the river reported in recent days. Another boat, carrying about 60 people, sank Saturday in the same area, although there were conflicting reports as to whether those aboard had been civilians or Taliban fighters.</p>

        <p>The Afghan Defense Ministry said Tuesday that a boat full of fleeing Taliban fighters had been fired upon by NATO helicopters and sunk in the Helmand River, in southern Afghanistan. All on board, between 20 and 30 guerrillas, drowned, said Gen. Zaher Azimi, a ministry spokesman.</p>
        <p>It was the second sinking on the river reported in recent days. Another boat, carrying about 60 people, sank Saturday in the same area, although there were conflicting reports as to whether those aboard had been civilians or Taliban fighters.</p>
        <p>General Azimi said that in Tuesday's episode, NATO helicopters had fired on the boat after receiving fire from gunmen on the vessel.</p>
        <p>He also reported heavy fighting elsewhere. Afghan troops were ambushed in Kandahar Province, also in southern Afghanistan. The soldiers called in airstrikes that killed an estimated 20 to 40 of the Taliban, General Azimi said. Two Afghan soldiers were killed and three others wounded over 24 hours, he added.</p>
        <p>A member of the Taliban said one of five Afghan health workers kidnapped two months ago had been beheaded because Afghan officials refused to hand over the body of the Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah, who was killed last month. His body was shown to journalists in Kandahar and he was then buried in a secret location in the city, said Asadullah Khaled, the provincial governor.</p>
        <p>Afghan officials said that they could not confirm the report of the beheading, but that they were ready to hand over Mullah Dadullah's body to his relatives without any conditions.</p>
        <p>Two roadside bombs exploded on the outskirts of the city of Kandahar on Tuesday evening. One bomb was apparently aimed at a passing vehicle of the National Security Directorate, the other at a vehicle from the Iranian Consulate in Kandahar. Both bombs missed their mark, said Muhammad Ebrahim, a police officer, and no casualties were reported.</p>
