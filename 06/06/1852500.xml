        <p>The chairman and chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, faced more than two hours of criticism from shareholders at the annual meeting here Tuesday, but he countered that the company had made major progress in turning around its fortunes last year.

        <p>''We've made a lot of progress over the past several years,'' said Mr. Wagoner, 54, citing $9 billion in cuts in fixed costs last year as a result of closing 12 plants, reducing the work force by 34,000, and lowering health care and pension costs.</p>

        <p>The chairman and chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, faced more than two hours of criticism from shareholders at the annual meeting here Tuesday, but he countered that the company had made major progress in turning around its fortunes last year. And he urged patience for the long term.</p>
        <p>''We've made a lot of progress over the past several years,'' said Mr. Wagoner, 54, citing $9 billion in cuts in fixed costs last year as a result of closing 12 plants, reducing the work force by 34,000, and lowering health care and pension costs.</p>
        <p>But he said it would take time to turn around the company. ''It's not about short-term initiatives to react to short-term challenges,'' he said. ''We're taking the profound actions necessary to transform the company for the long haul.''</p>
        <p>Shareholders expressed their unhappiness with G.M.'s loss of $10.4 billion in 2005 and about $2 billion in 2006.</p>
        <p>''We've done turnarounds so many times we're going in circles,'' said James M. Dollinger, a shareholder..</p>
        <p>And John Lauve, who headed a dissident slate of 12 candidates for director, said: ''The continued decline of G.M. is evidence of the failure of this board,'' adding that Toyota ''would not allow this to happen.''</p>
        <p>The company's board nominees, however, prevailed easily with a 90 percent vote, as did two plans for management incentive compensation.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, said a new controller and 30 experienced accountants had been hired after an auditor determined that the company's internal controls for reporting financial results were ''deficient,'' leading to the need to restate earnings for recent years.</p>
        <p>All 10 shareholder proposals, which are advisory only, went down in defeat, but 7 of them managed to attain double-digit approval. A proposal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions received a yes vote of 26 percent, and one that would allow holders of 10 percent of the company's shares to call for a special stockholder meeting received a 41 percent vote.</p>
        <p>A proposal for cumulative voting, intended to give minority stockholders more influence in electing a director, dropped to 26 percent support from last year's high of 56 percent.</p>
        <p>On the question of whether G.M. could be a takeover target, Mr. Wagoner assured Evelyn Y. Davis, an outspoken shareholder rights advocate, that despite the announcement last month of a $7.4 billion buyout of Chrysler by a private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, G.M. was not going private.</p>
        <p>''We're following the news,'' he said. ''G.M. is not considering going private.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Davis prompted him to say ''never,'' he declined. ''Never is a long time. We have no plans, and we're not talking about it.''</p>
        <p>He told shareholders that one of G.M.'s top priorities for 2007 was to resolve an 18-month standoff over health care costs with its former parts subsidiary, the Delphi Corporation, that would allow it to emerge from bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>''We'll continue to drive for a cost-effective, consensual agreement to resolve the Delphi restructuring,'' he told shareholders, ''and to further reduce our still unsustainable health care bill, which was a staggering $4.8 billion in 2006.''</p>
        <p>Later he told a group of reporters that he believed that an agreement could be reached. ''My sense is that it's kind of coming together,'' sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner also told reporters that he expected consolidation in the industry, but that it would be in Europe rather than in the United States. And he pointed out that the size and scale of General Motors protected it to some extent because of its investment advantages over smaller companies, including the ability to buy costly technology.</p>
        <p>In response to a question about when the company would introduce the Chevrolet Volt, the hybrid-electric concept car that G.M. unveiled at this year's Detroit auto show, he said a target date had been set but declined to reveal it. He did suggest, however, that the usual industry window for new technology was three to four years.</p>
