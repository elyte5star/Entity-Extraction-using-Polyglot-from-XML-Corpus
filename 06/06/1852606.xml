        <p>Re ''Don't Point That Menu at My Child Please'' (May 30):</p>
        <p>One of my fondest memories of my son's childhood is of a time when we were traveling in California. We walked into a very nice place in Santa</p>
        <p>Cruz. It was early, and there were only a few diners. We asked the waiters what there might be on the menu that would be suitable for a 7-year-old, and within seconds we were talking to the chef! My son was delighted, the chef spoke to him quite directly and recommended the gnocchi, which he enjoyed very much. He ate gnocchi from that time forward and I think has remembered that meal and the chef's kindness as I have.</p>

        <p>In 1994, the Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, Calif., sponsored a children's menu contest. Our then 4-year-old daughter submitted her favorite items and won the runner-up award and a gift certificate to be used on the newly devised menu. Her selection included peanut butter and peach compote on matzo, cucumber sticks, apple and turkey quesadilla, mini artichokes, grilled drumsticks and corn on the cob. When she went to cash in on her certificate, she was presented with a gourmet and organic ''French fries and chicken fingers'' menu. She immediately put it aside and turned to her usual ''children's menu'': the appetizers and side-dish list.</p>

        <p>It disappoints me that David Kamp's solution to the chicken finger omnipresence in his child's diet is a more sophisticated kids' menu. The frequency with which Americans eat out is the underlying problem, not the menu. Why is the regularity of the home-cooked meal a thing of the past? Many would claim that, because both parents are working, no one has the time to spend over the stove, but my mother managed just fine while working 40 to 50 hours a week. Perhaps we've just gotten lazy. And you can't solve laziness with decadence. Let's get back to the kitchen table and reinvent the family dinner -- that would solve a number of social problems, not just too many chicken fingers.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Finally! We are starting to wake up to the fact that kids' menus in restaurants (even with otherwise high quality food) most often equals junk food. No wonder we have an epidemic of obesity in this country; not just because children eat unhealthy restaurant food but also because we are training their palates to appreciate only a narrow range of bland and fried foods. Why not do it as they do in Europe? There you can order anything off the adult menu for half price. Children's tastes at a young age learn to recognize and enjoy a wide variety and combination of flavorful foods, plus a helping of vegetables to boot. Very simple, very smart and very healthy.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In my mind, the writer David Kamp leaves one big factor out of the equation: the parents. They are as responsible for these choices as the restaurants offering them.</p>
        <p>Making children eat a real meal in a restaurant is the same hard work as making them eat the same thing at home. And exactly for that reason parents pick the easy way out in a restaurant and go with the true and tried. After all, they are all there to have an easy time. Just get dinner over with and then head home and into bed.</p>
