        <p>At the beginning of ''The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon,'' Karl Marx famously observes that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. He forgot to add that the commemoration of history can raise farce to a whole new level of absurdity. This, at any rate, is among the insights offered by the Romanian director Corneliu Porumboiu's acutely funny first feature, ''12:08 East of Bucharest.''</p>
        <p>''Was there, or was there not, a revolution in our town?'' This question (summed up in the movie's Romanian title, ''A Fost sau n-a fost?'') is asked by Mr. Jderescu (Teo Corban), a television talk-show host who has hastily assembled a panel of nobodies to look back, 16 years later, at the events of Dec. 22, 1989. Their town, Vaslui, where Mr. Porumboiu grew up, is depicted, not without affection, as a drab, rundown place where it is hard to imagine very much happening at all.</p>
        <p>Of course, no one would dispute that on the day in question there was indeed a revolution in Romania. A few minutes after noon, Nicolae Ceausescu relinquished power in one of the last and most violent of that year's popular revolts against Communist rule in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>But what were the people of Vaslui doing? Were they, like their fellow citizens in Bucharest and Timisoara, heroic agents of change, pouring onto the streets in defiance of a dictator? Or were they passively swept up in historical events, like crumbs pushed along by a ragged broom?</p>
        <p>''12:08 East of Bucharest,'' winner of the prize for best first feature at Cannes last year, offers a decidedly crumb's-eye view of Romanian history. Mr. Jderescu, who hates any mention that he was a textile engineer before going into television, is a vain, pretentious fellow, given to prefacing his on-air banalities with references to Plato and Heraclitus.</p>
        <p>His guests on the special 16th-anniversary broadcast are an alcoholic, debt-ridden teacher, Mr. Manescu (Ion Sapdaru), and Mr. Piscoci (Mircea Andreescu), a pensioner best known for playing Santa Claus at children's parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manescu claims to have been at the vanguard of the events of 1989. He insists that, along with a few friends (who have all conveniently died or emigrated since their moment of glory), he marched into the town square well before noon. Callers to the station dispute his story, among them supposed former member of Ceausescu's secret police who threatens to sue the station if his name is mentioned again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Porumboiu's film is, at first glance, as rumpled and unassuming as its weary, fatalistic inhabitants. Though it is modest, almost anecdotal, in scale, ''12:08 East of Bucharest'' is also characterized by a precise and sneaky formal wit.</p>
        <p>The first half follows the three main characters through the petty business of an ordinary day. Mr. Piscoci looks for a Santa Claus costume. Mr. Jderescu has breakfast with his wife and a tryst with one of his producers. Mr. Manescu collects his salary, pays off some of his creditors and borrows more money from a shopkeeper he had insulted in a bar the night before.</p>
        <p>When they convene in the studio, the film turns into a quiet, hilarious parody of small-scale video production. The camera wobbles on its tripod and interrupts its static tableau of three gloomy men at a table with clumsy zooms and pans. (''At last, a close-up!'' Jderescu sarcastically exclaims at one point as his jowly visage fills the screen).</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a production assistant's hand reaches in from outside the frame to clear the table of scraps of paper or to confiscate the paper boat old Mr. Piscoci has been distractedly folding.</p>
        <p>The desultory, deflated mood that pervades the film is also its main satirical point. As an ideology, Communism promised not only a better model of society, but also a whole new kind of person. The revolutions that punctured this fantasy thus represented, at least in part, a triumph of the same old thing, the revenge of a flawed, stumbling, anti-utopian conception of humanity against a totalitarian perfectionism.</p>
        <p>In answer to Mr. Jderescu's question, then, Mr. Porumboiu's film suggests that there was no revolution because the dull, basic facts of human life -- as incarnated by the deadpan Beckettian comedy of Jderescu, Piscoci and Manescu -- resist dramatic change.</p>
        <p>While this view may seem cynical, it also proves to be tolerant and generous. By the end of the day, as the streetlights flicker to life in Vaslui, the grandiose talk of heroism and cowardice fades into a quieter understanding, at once bleak and consoling. History is made -- or at least endured -- by the humble and the foolish as well as the brave.</p>
        <p>12:08 East of Bucharest  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
