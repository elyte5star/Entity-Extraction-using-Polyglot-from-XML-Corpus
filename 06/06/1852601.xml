        <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has told a gay rights organization that she supports the repeal of one provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law signed by her husband that says states and the federal government do not have to recognize gay marriages and unions from other states. On the questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign, Mrs. Clinton said she opposed the part of the law that would prohibit the federal government from recognizing same-sex relationships. Her advisers said that she continued to oppose gay marriage. Her response on the questionnaire puts her in line with her rivals for her party's nomination.</p>
