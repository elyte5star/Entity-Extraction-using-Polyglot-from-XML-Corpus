        <p>Phil Mickelson has decided to skip the St. Jude Championship in Memphis this week as he tries to recuperate from an injured left wrist in time for the United States Open, which begins June 14 at Oakmont Country Club near Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>After receiving a second opinion Monday in San Diego, Mickelson decided to receive a cortisone injection in the wrist to help relieve the pain. He sustained the injury while practicing at Oakmont on May 28 and aggravated it at the first round of last week's Memorial Tournament; he withdrew after 11 holes.</p>
        <p>''The timing isn't the best because I really wanted to play at Memphis,'' Mickelson said yesterday in a statement. ''But the good news is there is no break or fracture. I have inflammation that can be relieved, and I'm looking forward to playing the Open at 100 percent physically.''</p>
        <p>Mickelson, who won the Players Championship last month, has four runner-up finishes in the Open, including last year at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Oakmont is scheduled to be his first major championship under the tutelage of Butch Harmon, the former teacher of Tiger Woods.</p>
