        <p>Re ''Our Green Bubble,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 3):</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman is correct in his advocacy of a gasoline tax to provide incentive for conservation and alternative fuels development. But the regressive nature of such a tax, which might cost an average driver $500 to $1,000 a year, would place an additional burden on lower-income individuals, and it would hardly slow down higher-income individuals in pursuit of high-power automobiles.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Our Green Bubble,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 3):</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman is correct in his advocacy of a gasoline tax to provide incentive for conservation and alternative fuels development. But the regressive nature of such a tax, which might cost an average driver $500 to $1,000 a year, would place an additional burden on lower-income individuals, and it would hardly slow down higher-income individuals in pursuit of high-power automobiles.</p>
        <p>A solution for low- to middle-income individuals might be to let the gas tax offset another regressive assessment, like Social Security, basically having the government pay, say, the first $600 of Social Security assessment for lower-income taxpayers out of the revenue generated by the gasoline tax.</p>
        <p>This would make the tax essentially revenue-neutral for lower-income people, but it would give them the incentive for added savings through conservation (car pooling, public transportation and so on).</p>
        <p>The financial incentives to go green for upper-income individuals will have to be greater than the return on investment generated by a gas tax. This might mean adding a fairly stiff gas-guzzler tax, assessed yearly on new autos bought after the legislation is enacted that get less than, say, 35 miles per gallon.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As usual, Thomas L. Friedman is dead on with his comments about energy reform in this country. This once again illustrates that as with most problems in this country, campaign finance is the problem.</p>
        <p>When we ban all contributions by special interests, and set an amount of public money that each candidate can spend in an election, we will have our democracy back.</p>
