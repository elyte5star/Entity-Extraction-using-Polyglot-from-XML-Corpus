        <p>Oprah Goes for 'Middlesex'</p>
        <p>''Middlesex'' (Picador), a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, is the new selection of Oprah's Book Club. The choice of the book, an epic of three generations of Greek-Americans narrated by a person who discovered at 14 that she was a hermaphrodite, was announced by Oprah Winfrey yesterday on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' The Associated Press reported. ''I promise it will grab you from the first sentence,'' she said. Ms. Winfrey also came up with a rare television interview with Cormac McCarthy, 73, above, author of her previous choice, ''The Road'' (Alfred A. Knopf), a story about a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world. Mr. McCarthy said he would not have written the novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize, had he not had a son as an older man. ''It wrenches you up out of your nap and makes you look at things fresh,'' he said. ''It forces the world on you, and I think it's a good thing.'' Mr. McCarthy said he has nothing against the news media but doesn't believe he should be talking about what he does. He told of a time years ago when, although he had no money, he turned down a speaking engagement that would have paid him $2,000. ''You work your side of the street, I'll work mine,'' he said.</p>
        <p>British TV Channel Spurns Princes' Plea</p>
        <p>Rejecting an appeal from Princes William and Harry, Channel 4 in Britain said yesterday that it will broadcast photographs that were taken immediately after the automobile crash that killed their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, nearly 10 years ago, The Associated Press reported. ''If it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel, would we want the scene broadcast to the nation?'' Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, the princes' private secretary, asked in a letter to Channel 4 that was released to the news media. The princes had protested the images in the show, saying that broadcasting them would be a ''gross disrespect'' to their mother's memory and ''deeply distressing'' to them. The documentary, ''Diana: The Witness in the Tunnel,'' focuses on the role of photographers in the crash that killed Diana; Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, known as Dodi; and their driver, Henri Paul, on Aug. 31, 1997. Channel 4 said, ''We acknowledge that there is great public sensitivity surrounding pictures of the victims, and these have not been included. Some photographs will be of the scene inside the tunnel, but in none of the pictures is it possible to identify Diana or indeed any of the crash victims.''</p>
        <p>Promotion for Waterston?</p>
        <p>If Fred Thompson wants a new job as President of the United States, Sam Waterston, below, is interested in his old one, New York district attorney on ''Law &amp; Order,'' The Associated Press reported. Citing a source who spoke only on condition of anonymity, the news agency said Mr. Waterston, who has been with ''Law &amp; Order'' for 13 years and plays executive assistant district attorney Jack McCoy, would take over for Mr. Thompson's District Attorney Arthur Branch when the show returns in midseason. Mr. Thompson, a Republican and former United States senator from Tennessee, is considering a run for the White House. NBC and Dick Wolf, executive producer of ''Law &amp; Order,'' declined to comment on Monday, as did Mr. Waterston's representative.</p>
        <p>Conductor Sentenced For Sexual Abuse</p>
        <p>Gasping and visibly pale, the renowned British conductor Robert King, founder of the King's Consort orchestra and choir, heard himself sentenced on Monday to nearly four years in prison for groping teenage musicians, the Press Association of Britain reported. A jury of five men and seven women in Isleworth Crown Court in London heard testimony that Mr. King, 46, plied most of his victims with alcohol before attacking them at his home, sometimes while they slept or bathed. Mr. King insisted that his accusers were ''absolute liars,'' but the prosecutor, Sarah Whitehouse, told the jurors, ''It flies in the face of reason that five people should independently make these allegations up.'' The jury deliberated for more than 21 hours over five days before convicting Mr. King of 14 accounts of indecent assault over an 11 years.</p>
        <p>Alan Ayckbourn Eases Up</p>
        <p>The prolific English playwright Alan Ayckbourn, 68, whose plays include ''Absurd Person Singular,'' ''The Norman Conquests'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Bedroom Farce,'' will step down in 2008 after 37 years as the artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theater in Scarborough, England, the BBC reported. He will continue to direct his plays at the theater and any new work by him will have its premiere there. Sue Truefitt, head of the theater's board, said Mr. Ayckbourn, who had a stroke last year and was knighted this year, would direct two plays in the coming season and was planning the 2008-09 season. A new artistic director will be appointed to plan the 2009-10 season.</p>
        <p>Charges Against the Game</p>
        <p>The hip-hop star the Game, below, has been charged with making a criminal threat and possessing a firearm in a school zone, The Associated Press reported. The Los Angeles district attorney's office said the felony charges against the Game, whose real name is Jayceon Terrell Taylor, arose from a pickup basketball game on Feb. 24 in South Los Angeles, where, the police said, he pulled a gun from his red Cadillac Escalade after punching an opposing player and threatened to shoot him. The Game was arrested on May 11 at his home in Glendale and released on $50,000 bail. He is also charged with exhibiting a firearm in the presence of an officer. If convicted, he could be sentenced to more than five years in state prison. His lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Callas Costume Resurfaces</p>
        <p>A costume once worn by the opera star Maria Callas (1923-1977) that was stolen last month has been returned anonymously by mail to the Italian cultural center in Athens where it was on display, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. Callas wore the costume at a performance of Verdi's ''Aida'' in Athens in 1957. Greece has organized a series of events this year to honor the American-born Callas and emphasize her Greek background.</p>
