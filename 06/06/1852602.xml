        <p>JERSEY CITY, June 5  Democratic voters in urban New Jersey delivered a mixed message to traditional machine politics in Tuesday’s legislative primaries.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Democratic voters in urban New Jersey delivered a mixed message to traditional machine politics in Tuesday's legislative primaries.</p>
        <p>In one hotly contested primary for the State Senate in northern Hudson County, Assemblyman Brian P. Stack trounced his colleague in the Legislature, Assemblyman Silverio A. Vega, who had the support of the historically powerful Hudson County Democratic Organization.</p>
        <p>But in the other marquee battle for the Senate, in the southern end of the county, the Democratic organization's choice, Sandra A. Bolden Cunningham, the widow of popular former mayor, defeated Assemblyman Louis M. Manzo.</p>
        <p>In Essex County, a slate of younger and more inexperienced candidates backed by Cory A. Booker, the mayor of Newark, won four of six races, with one too close to call. But D. Bilal Beasley, Mr. Booker's choice for a crucial Senate race, lost to the incumbent, Senator Ronald L. Rice.</p>
        <p>''If anything, we proved we have a lot of coattail,'' Mr. Booker told supporters in a victory speech. ''We were able to get our people elected.''</p>
        <p>The contests were the focus of a busy slate of primary races across the state, as voters chose party candidates to compete in the general election on Nov. 6. All 40 seats in the Senate and all 80 in the Assembly are at stake.</p>
        <p>Since most legislative districts are drawn so that one party dominates, Tuesday's winners are now heavily favored to win.</p>
        <p>Most political analysts predict that, barring any surprises or scandals, both houses will remain safely in the hands of the Democrats, who now control the Senate (22 to 18) and the Assembly (50 to 30).</p>
        <p>Still, with more than a dozen legislators choosing to retire or not run for re-election, many new and decidedly younger faces are expected when the next legislative session convenes in January.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's contests mirrored previous elections in that voter turnout was reported to be light, even in the most competitive districts.</p>
        <p>During the 2003 primary, the last time the primary was topped by races for the Assembly and Senate, 9 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.</p>
        <p>For Republicans, one of the most keenly watched races was for State Senate in the 24th District in northwestern New Jersey. With Senator Robert E. Littell retiring after four decades in Trenton -- the longest tenure in state history -- Mr. Littell's handpicked choice, Steve Oroho, a Sussex County freeholder and wealthy businessman, edged Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg.</p>
        <p>The other major race for Republicans, also for the Senate, was in the 40th District in northeastern New Jersey, to succeed another retiring legislator, Senator Henry P. McNamara.</p>
        <p>In a bitter race, Assemblyman Kevin J. O'Toole defeated Todd C. Caliguire, a former Bergen County freeholder, who had the support of the Bergen County Republican Organization, which has stumbled badly in the last few elections.</p>
        <p>But for New Jersey's political establishment, the most important races focused on classic urban politics in the state's two biggest cities, Newark and Jersey City.</p>
        <p>In the 33rd District, Mr. Stack, who is also the mayor of Union City, defeated Mr. Vega, who is also the mayor of West New York . Mr. Stack's running mates for the Assembly -- Ruben J. Ramos Jr. and Caridad Rodriguez -- also won easily.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stack benefited from a strong grass-roots organization. And in his victory speech, he thumbed his nose at the Hudson County Democratic Organization.</p>
        <p>''This victory that we enjoyed tonight is the people's victory of Hudson County!'' he shouted, as people in the audience cried, ''Si se puede!'' or ''Yes, we can!''</p>
        <p>In the 31st District, which covers Bayonne and part of Jersey City, Ms. Cunningham, the widow of Glenn D. Cunningham, who was Jersey City's first African-American mayor, and a state senator as well, overcame numerous missteps to defeat Mr. Manzo.</p>
        <p>Her running mates for Assembly, L. Harvey Smith and Anthony Chiappone, also won.</p>
        <p>It was one of the more vitriolic races in recent memory: Mr. Manzo denounced Ms. Cunningham for defending a campaign volunteer who was revealed to be a paroled sex offender, while Ms. Cunningham linked Mr. Manzo to a longtime ally who had served two years in federal prison for bank fraud.</p>
        <p>In her victory speech, she thanked God, and her husband.</p>
        <p>''I know my husband, Glenn, is looking down,'' she said, before thrusting her thumb in the air, ''and saying, 'All right!' ''</p>
        <p>In Newark, the primary was viewed as an important gauge of Mr. Booker's political clout. But in supporting a roster of self-described reformers, some of them political neophytes, Mr. Booker risked roiling longtime enemies and allies.</p>
        <p>One candidate supported by Mr. Booker, M. Teresa Ruiz, ran unopposed in capturing the State Senate nomination for the 29th District. But she will face a stiff challenge in the fall from Assemblyman William D. Payne. He is a member of a powerful family of elected officials whose power runs from Washington to the streets of the Central Ward, and he is running as an independent.</p>
