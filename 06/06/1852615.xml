        <p>PDT  Inside Crif Dogs, 113 St. Marks Place (Avenue A), (212) 614-2728.</p>
        <p>It took three centuries, but at last New Yorkers can walk into a bar and order a mint julep with a deep-fried hot dog wrapped in bacon.</p>
        <p>Before walking in, though, they'll have to go through an elaborate screening ritual: step into a hot dog joint, slip into the phone booth, smile at the camera and wait for the secret door to swing open.</p>
        <p>One can view this speak-easy pantomime as a necessary crowd-control measure given that the demand for juleps and bacon dogs is likely to be ferocious. Or one can view it as undiluted affectation. (What kind of speak-easy invites food writers to its opening preview?)</p>
        <p>But one will probably forgive anything after knocking back one of PDT's precisely calibrated, classically inclined cocktails ($11).</p>
        <p>As in all right-minded cocktail bars these days, the glasses are small, the ice cubes huge and the bartenders as rigorous as Jesuits.</p>
        <p>When somebody asked for a caipirinha last week, the bartender said apologetically that he could make one but that it wouldn't be authentic because he didn't have the right kind of sugar.</p>
