        <p>The police said yesterday that they were seeking a man who recently robbed guests at two hotels in Manhattan. In the first robbery, on April 13 at the Millenium Hilton downtown, the man followed a couple and a 9-year-old girl to their room, held them at gunpoint, then bound and robbed them of cash, jewelry and electronics, the police said. In the second robbery, on Thursday night at the Roosevelt Hotel on East 45th Street, the man forced himself into a woman's room as she was entering, assaulted her and took her handbag, the police said. The robber is described as a white man, about 5 foot 7 and about 25 years old, with a stocky build, wearing a blue baseball cap and a black pea coat. Anyone with information should call 1-800-577-TIPS, the police said.</p>
