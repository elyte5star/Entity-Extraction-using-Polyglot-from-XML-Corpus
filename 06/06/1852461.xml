        <p>PUPUSAS, sunburns, soccer: could this be the last summer to get them all at the same place?</p>
        <p>For years a pan-Latin group of food vendors has assembled each Saturday and Sunday at Bay and Clinton Streets in Brooklyn, drawing fans of street food from all over the city to the Red Hook Recreation Area.</p>
        <p>The Food Vendors Committee, their umbrella organization, has had a series of temporary use permits, regularly renewed. But the Parks Department now says that if the vendors are to stay at the ball fields, they will need to bid for their space like vendors at other parks and have the bid accepted by the city.</p>
        <p>Cesar Fuentes, executive director of the group, said that when he renewed the temporary permit most recently (ensuring that the vendors would be at the park through Sept. 8), he was told that he could not renew it again, even though the vendors' season usually ends in October. The news came ''like a bucket of ice water,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Warner Johnston, chief spokesman for the Parks Department, said it was trying to apply the same rules and permits for all vendors in all parks. He said department officials hoped the vendors' group would submit a bid.</p>
        <p>''We love these groups,'' Mr. Johnston said. ''We know what a resource they are.''</p>
        <p>He said the organization now pays about $9,000 a season, but he had no idea how much a successful bid for a permit would cost. (Permits for hot dog stands in Central Park vary hugely, he said, depending on location: from $600 to $300,000 a season.) No other requests have been received for the space in Red Hook.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuentes said the vendors' worst fear was that a big company would win the bid. But of the Parks Department, he said, ''I have faith they'll do what's in the best interest of the community and what's right for the people who use the park.''</p>
