        <p>Pakistani officials said they were investigating two people arrested Monday in Kashmor, a remote town in the southern province of Sindh, for any links to the killing of the American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002.</p>
        <p>Noor Ahmed Paichuho, the Kashmor police chief, said in a telephone interview that the men, Attaur Rehman and Faisal Bhatti, were being interrogated in Kashmor.</p>
        <p>Javed Iqbal Cheema, a retired brigadier who is the director of the national crisis management office here in the capital, said the men were involved with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned Sunni Muslim militant group. ''We are investigating if they are the same persons involved in Pearl murder or not,'' Brigadier Cheema said. ''Let's wait and see.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was kidnapped in Karachi while looking into ties between Al Qaeda and the shoe bomber Richard C. Reid, who was convicted of trying to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight in December 2001.</p>
        <p>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a top commander for Al Qaeda who was captured in Pakistan in 2003, claimed to have decapitated Mr. Pearl.</p>
