        <p>Summer at Mannes College the New School for Music is a seamless succession of mini-festivals and institutes that cover everything from music theory and analysis to keyboard virtuosity, contemporary music and the guitar and vocal repertory. The main purpose is to instruct the conservatory's students, but the programs also give the school a public presence by way of open master classes, lectures, panel discussions and performances. The Mannes Beethoven Institute, which began its weeklong run on Sunday, is now in its seventh year and has been directed from the start by the pianist Thomas Sauer.</p>
        <p>This year's program includes two faculty concerts (there are student recitals as well), conceived as snapshots of Beethoven: the first, on Monday, showed the composer as a young firebrand, influenced by both the courtliness and rustic robustness of Haydn and Mozart.</p>

        <p>Summer at Mannes College the New School for Music is a seamless succession of mini-festivals and institutes that cover everything from music theory and analysis to keyboard virtuosity, contemporary music and the guitar and vocal repertory. The main purpose is to instruct the conservatory's students, but the programs also give the school a public presence by way of open master classes, lectures, panel discussions and performances. The Mannes Beethoven Institute, which began its weeklong run on Sunday, is now in its seventh year and has been directed from the start by the pianist Thomas Sauer.</p>
        <p>This year's program includes two faculty concerts (there are student recitals as well), conceived as snapshots of Beethoven: the first, on Monday, showed the composer as a young firebrand, influenced by both the courtliness and rustic robustness of Haydn and Mozart.</p>
        <p>The second, on Friday evening, is devoted to works from Beethoven's final years, when his compositional alchemy transformed the Classicism of his youth into an expansive, complex, deeply personal language that seemed to tap directly into the heart of both composer and listener.</p>
        <p>One thing the Monday program demonstrated was that ''early Beethoven'' covers considerable stylistic ground. Mr. Sauer opened the concert with a vigorous performance of the Sonata No. 16 in G (Op. 31, No. 1), actually the latest work to be played, and the most rambunctious. Its chunky chordal opening and its exuberant finale show us a composer who draws his energy from at least the pretense of iconoclastic recklessness.</p>
        <p>But then, what do we make of the same work's gracefully ornamented Adagio grazioso? Mr. Sauer played it with an elegant formality that showed it for what it was: a feisty composer's moment of good behavior between raucous pranks.</p>
        <p>Yuri Kim played the Sonata No. 7 in D (Op. 10, No. 3) with a trimness that suited its more overtly Haydnesque qualities. She is a powerful player, and if she was at her best in the brisk outer movements, she gave the slow movement a touching, plangent quality that looked ahead to Beethoven's later works.</p>
        <p>The strongest performances were Ignat Solzhenitsyn's two contributions. His account of the Sonata No. 10 in G (Op. 14, No. 2) was a model of transparent textures, rhythmic precision and animated lyricism. Here the thrill was less in Beethoven's incipient rebellion as in his mastery of Classical contours.</p>
        <p>And in the Piano Quartet in E flat (Op. 16), for which Mr. Solzhenitsyn was joined by members of the Brentano String Quartet, we find Beethoven at his most Mozartean. The work touches on both the regal and the folksy, and demands a cheerful, spirited interplay that these musicians delivered with unfailing vitality.</p>
        <p>The final faculty concert is Friday at Mannes College the New School for Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan; (212) 580-0210, newschool.edu/mannes/summer.</p>
