        <p>William Chase, of Herefordshire, England, must have had the export market in mind for his new line of potato chips. Why else would an Englishman call them chips instead of crisps? But Mr. Chase -- who grows, slices, fries, flavors and packages the potatoes on his farm, Tyrrells Court -- can call them anything he wants: he has come up with flavors with new personality. How about asparagus and crushed black pepper? Or mature Cheddar and chives? Not that you will go wrong with the simple sea salt variety. Some, like the asparagus, and Ludlow sausage and mustard, are seasonal and available only by calling or visiting Chelsea Market Baskets, the importer, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street). But others are sold online at chelseamarketbaskets.com, $19 for five 5.3-ounce bags. In the store they are $3.99 a bag: (212) 727-1111.</p>
