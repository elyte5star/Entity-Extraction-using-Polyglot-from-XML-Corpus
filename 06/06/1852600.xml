        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin suggested that he would reappoint Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow, who had previously said that he would leave office after his term expired in December. The leaders of Russia's 86 regions, which include Moscow, have served at the president's behest since constitutional changes passed after the Beslan terrorist attack in 2004. A power broker in his own right, Mr. Luzhkov, above with Mr. Putin, has used his popularity to win two popular elections since his appointment in 1992. At a tour of an experimental affordable housing project in Moscow, Mr. Putin asked the mayor to remain in office, ostensibly to address several outstanding housing problems in the capital. The Kremlin will likely seek to wield Mr. Luzhkov's influence for its benefit in the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.</p>
