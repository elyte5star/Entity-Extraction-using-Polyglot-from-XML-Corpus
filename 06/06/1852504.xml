        <p>A reputed mobster associated with the Gambino crime family was shot at least three times while sitting in his car on a Brooklyn street yesterday morning, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Robert DeCicco, 56, was hit in the arm and leg and grazed in the head while parked in front of 1678 Bath Avenue in Bath Beach about 10:30 a.m., the police said. He was treated at Lutheran Medical Center and released.</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. DeCicco, who lives on Staten Island, was indicted on federal racketeering charges in Brooklyn along with his father, George DeCicco, and 11 others as part of an 11-month investigation of the Gambino and Luchese families and the Sicilian Mafia.</p>
        <p>George DeCicco is a high-ranking Gambino captain, federal authorities said. The charges against the group included racketeering, loan-sharking, extortion, bribery of a federal official, money laundering, attempted bank fraud and check forgery.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said that before the shooting yesterday, Mr. DeCicco went to get a prescription filled at Dolinsky Pharmacy and then went to the nearby Nick's Discount Store. He was shot after getting back into his car, according to the police. A light-colored Lincoln sped away immediately after the shooting, investigators said. No one had been arrested last night.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time a member of the DeCicco family has been the victim of violence. Robert DeCicco's cousin, Frank DeCicco, was killed in a car explosion outside a Bensonhurst social club on April 13, 1986.</p>
