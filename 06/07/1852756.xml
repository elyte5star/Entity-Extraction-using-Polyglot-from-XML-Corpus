        <p>For more than two hours, Rafael Nadal played his quarterfinal match at the French Open as if he had never seen the man on the opposite side of the net.</p>
        <p>As soon as he stepped on to the court, he knit his brow and glared. Time and again, he rudely aimed his shots out of his opponent's reach. Unemotionally, he sent his signature forehands spinning over the net, without consideration that his opponent might be unable to handle them.</p>

        <p>For more than two hours, Rafael Nadal played his quarterfinal match at the French Open as if he had never seen the man on the opposite side of the net.</p>
        <p>As soon as he stepped on to the court, he knit his brow and glared. Time and again, he rudely aimed his shots out of his opponent's reach. Unemotionally, he sent his signature forehands spinning over the net, without consideration that his opponent might be unable to handle them.</p>
        <p>To make it to the final of this tournament, Nadal would not place nice, even for one second, even against his longtime friend and mentor, Carlos Moyá. So Nadal went out Wednesday at Roland Garros and disposed of Moyá, 6-4, 6-3, 6-0.</p>
        <p>''So, well, the match was better for me, like than for him, that's for sure,'' Nadal said later, as he morphed back into the goofy young Spaniard he is off the court.</p>
        <p>Nadal, who turned 21 this week, was only 12 when Moyá, a fellow Majorcan, lifted the French Open champion's trophy in 1998. Now Nadal is looking to win his third French Open in a row, and his victory against the 30-year-old Moyá put him one step closer to that.</p>
        <p>One look at Nadal at the start of the match showed how much he wanted the victory. He had warmed up so thoroughly he was dripping with sweat, his dark shaggy hair matted to his head. He knew he had to be ready against Moyá, who had practiced with him for many years and knew his moves well.</p>
        <p>After the victory, Nadal, seeded second, said he was happy because he had played his best tennis of the tournament. He has not lost a single set here.</p>
        <p>''That shows how much better he is to the other guys,'' said Moyá, who had 38 unforced errors to Nadal's 15.</p>
        <p>''I think that there are just a few players who can, not just -- not beat him, but even get a set from him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Novak Djokovic, seeded sixth and one of the three Serbs in the men's and women's semifinals, is one of those players.</p>
        <p>Djokovic, 20, is next in line to play Nadal at Roland Garros. No. 1 Roger Federer will play No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko in the other semifinal.</p>
        <p>In March, Djokovic found a way to beat Nadal at this year's Masters Series event in Miami, which was played on a hard court. But even here on Roland Garros's clay, Djokovic said he had a chance of beating Nadal again. Even if it was only a small one.</p>
        <p>''He's the best player in the world on this surface, and everybody knows that,'' Djokovic said.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Djokovic continued to lead the surge of Serbian players here by defeating 125th-ranked Igor Andreev in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. His compatriots -- No. 4 Jelena Jankovic and No. 7 Ana Ivanovic -- will play in Thursday's women's semifinals.</p>
        <p>Ivanovic will play No. 2 Maria Sharapova, while Jankovic will meet No. 1 Justine Henin, who has been the French Open champion three of the last four years.</p>
        <p>The Serbian cheering section, which is growing by the moment, made itself known during Djokovic's match Wednesday. About a dozen of Djokovic's family and friends cheered and clapped in unison while he was on the court. Djokovic was wearing his lucky yellow shirt, and more than a dozen of those fans followed suit.</p>
        <p>Glimpsing that sea of yellow made Djokovic laugh as he went on to beat Andreev without too many problems. Andreev had beaten No. 3 Andy Roddick in the first round, but was not surprised that his tournament ended with the match against Djokovic.</p>
        <p>''I think his stronger point is that he hits no bad shots,'' Andreev said. ''He does very good everything. He's defending very well. He's serving well on important points.</p>
        <p>''So he's a strong guy,'' he said. ''I'm surprised, like, mentally, he's so strong for the young age that he is.''</p>
        <p>Later, Nadal called Djokovic a ''potential future No. 1'' because of his big serve and aggressiveness. Both parts of Djokovic's game have improved this year, turning him into one of the few players who could challenge Nadal or Federer for the title here.</p>
        <p>Djokovic said he could not see himself as a Grand Slam winner -- yet -- because he would have to beat Nadal to get there. Last year, he lost to Nadal in the quarterfinals after retiring with a back injury. He is bracing himself for another round.</p>
        <p>''He plays with a lot of motivation and confidence,'' Djokovic said of Nadal. ''And physically he is very ready and probably the most prepared player on the Tour.''</p>
        <p>Against Moyá, Nadal made sure he was prepared. He loosened up by running and bouncing around the locker room as if he were a child who had ingested too much sugar.</p>
        <p>As the days go on, the pressure grows for him to win again at Roland Garros. But this year, more than any other, he said he feels more physically and mentally ready for this tournament.</p>
        <p>''I feel better because I can play a little bit different,'' he said, comparing his performances with last year's. ''I can play a little bit more aggressive. I can play defense sometimes, but I can attack, too. So that's a little bit of an advantage.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Federer is feeling good, too, particularly after beating Nadal last month in Hamburg, Germany, to break Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay.</p>
        <p>''Yes, don't mention the name Federer again,'' Nadal said earlier this week, with a grin.</p>
