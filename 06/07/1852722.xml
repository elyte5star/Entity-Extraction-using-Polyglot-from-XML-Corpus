        <p>It's summertime, and catching your favorite TV shows is not so easy when you are on vacation or a weekend outing. A cheap, portable TV is one option, but what if you've developed a taste for high definition? Plextor has come out with its Mini Digital HDTV Receiver, which connects to a laptop's U.S.B. port. The receiver, which sells for $99 and is available at www.plextor.com, has an external antenna and software that scans for over-the-air HD signals.</p>
        <p>Plextor's receiver works only with computers running Windows XP or Vista. The more computing horsepower you have -- both memory and graphics -- the better your viewing experience. Underpowered systems can produce a picture that occasionally stutters.</p>

        <p>It's summertime, and catching your favorite TV shows is not so easy when you are on vacation or a weekend outing. A cheap, portable TV is one option, but what if you've developed a taste for high definition? Plextor has come out with its Mini Digital HDTV Receiver, which connects to a laptop's U.S.B. port. The receiver, which sells for $99 and is available at www.plextor.com, has an external antenna and software that scans for over-the-air HD signals.</p>
        <p>Plextor's receiver works only with computers running Windows XP or Vista. The more computing horsepower you have -- both memory and graphics -- the better your viewing experience. Underpowered systems can produce a picture that occasionally stutters.</p>
        <p>The software, called ArtecMedia from Ultima, allows you to switch channels and record and play back shows. You can also set a schedule of shows to record. Of course, the PC and the software must be running to time-shift shows this way. The receiver draws its power from the laptop, so you may want to plug in before you veg out.</p>
