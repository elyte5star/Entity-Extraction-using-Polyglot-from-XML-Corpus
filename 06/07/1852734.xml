        <p>SINCE Gov. Eliot Spitzer reappointed me chief judge three months ago, fair pay for our judges has been the consuming issue. In these critical, final days before the Legislature adjourns, New Yorkers deserve a frank explanation of why raising judicial pay and replacing New York's broken system of compensation matter -- and why so much is at stake if Albany fails to act now.</p>
        <p>As our country's founders warned centuries ago, the independence and quality of the judiciary is what keeps this democracy prosperous and free. Only when judges serve without fear or favor can rights be enforced, powers balanced, debts recovered, promises kept and justice done. Diminish confidence in the quality and independence of judges, and our cherished liberties suffer too.</p>
        <p>These are the stakes today because New York State's judicial salaries have fallen so low for a modern judiciary. The salary of a trial court judge, $136,700, is near the bottom of the nation's judicial pay scale. Federal judges, law school professors, government lawyers and even many law students with summer jobs in major firms earn more. Our judges have gone nearly nine years without even a cost-of-living adjustment, longer than any other judges in America.</p>
        <p>Why no increase? It is not because anyone questions the need for raises, and not for lack of funds. The problem is the longstanding tradition of tying judicial pay raises to legislative pay raises. Albany is unwilling to bring state judicial salaries up to par this year without a pay raise for legislators, something that has been prevented by political divisions and other unrelated issues.</p>
        <p>Fearful that this salary squeeze will discourage the most qualified lawyers from seeking or continuing judicial service, the state bar has implored the Legislature to act. As lawyers for 37 major companies noted just last week, "Ultimately, New York's business community, and all New Yorkers, will pay the price."</p>
        <p>Experienced judges increasingly talk of resigning so they can afford to continue to live in New York and educate their children. Outstanding lawyers for whom judicial service should be a calling see it as a sacrifice they cannot afford. When we shortchange the courts, all New Yorkers suffer.</p>
        <p>The solution is clear: take judicial compensation out of politics. Give state judges an immediate pay increase, to bring them up to $165,200, which is similar to what their counterparts in the federal courts earn. And create a commission -- as many other states have -- to determine judges' salaries based on objective criteria, regularly and transparently.</p>
        <p>Preserve the democracy our founders envisioned, in which elected leaders make policy based on public interest, and assure a strong, independent, adequately compensated judiciary. Let our courts continue to serve New Yorkers with the excellence they deserve.</p>
