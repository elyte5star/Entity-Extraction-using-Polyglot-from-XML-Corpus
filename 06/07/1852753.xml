        <p>2 Republican Candidates Say No to Iowa Straw Poll  Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator John McCain said they would skip what has been an early test of candidate strength, this summer's straw poll in Ames, Iowa. Their decision was an indication of how much the changing primary calendar has upended presidential politics as candidates grapple with the prospect of primaries in crucial states like Florida on Jan. 29 and California, New York and Texas a week later.</p>
        <p>PAGE A26</p>
        <p>A Posthumous Presence at the Venice Biennale  While artists like Jason Rhoades, whose ''Tijuanatanjierchandelier'' is above, will show at the biennale, Felix Gonzalez-Torres will be the official United States representative long after his death.</p>
        <p>THE ARTS, PAGE E1</p>
        <p>Big Mother Is Watching  A mother recently joined Facebook, the social networking site that recently expanded its membership beyond students, to keep up with her teenagers. Her daughter viewed it as super creepy. Cyberfamilias, by Michelle Slatalla.</p>
        <p>PAGE G1</p>
        <p>Inside the Glass House  Philip Johnson's Glass House, the Modernist masterpiece in New Canaan, Conn., that was also his home, opens to the public this month. It has barely changed in 58 years.</p>

        <p>DNA Variations of Diseases  Applying a new technique to a large group of patients, researchers have detected DNA variations that underlie seven common diseases. The variations pinpoint biological pathways for each disease, and researchers hope that as the pathways are analyzed, new treatments will emerge.</p>
        <p>PAGE A32</p>
        <p>Immigration Plan Survives  The Senate signaled support for major provisions of an immigration bill by rejecting many proposed amendments, including one that would have made it much harder for many illegal immigrants to achieve legal status. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said, ''We have made a lot of progress.''</p>
        <p>PAGE A31</p>
        <p>Ducks Capture Stanley Cup  The Anaheim Ducks defeated the Ottawa Senators, 6-2, in Game 5 of their best-of-seven series, winning their first Stanley Cup title and the first for a team from the West Coast.</p>

        <p>Pakistan Detains Opponents  The police arrested more than 300 political party workers in a crackdown before a protest planned this week against curbs on the media, especially independent TV. The government says the decree just tightens current regulations.</p>
        <p>PAGE A19</p>
        <p>An Add-On To Rabbit Ears  The nearly 20 million homes that rely on rabbit ears or antennas for TV reception will receive as much as $80 to ease the move to digital. The government plans to spend $1.5 billion on the program; broadcasters will spend $100 million to get out the word.</p>
