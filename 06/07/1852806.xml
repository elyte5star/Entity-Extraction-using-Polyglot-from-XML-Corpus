        <p>Muhammad is now the second most popular name for baby boys in Britain, outstripped only by Jack, The Times of London reported. It said it based its conclusion on an analysis of 3,000 names provided by the Office for National Statistics for births in 2006 and had taken into account 14 different spellings for the name. Using the spelling Muhammad in its article, the newspaper said that the popularity of the name came from the growing number of young Muslim couples having families. Many of these parents chose the name of the prophet in order to show a solidarity with their religion, the newspaper said. According to the Times analysis, Muhammad (5,991) could outscore Jack (6,928) by the end of this year if the name's current rate of popularity continued. The names Thomas and Joshua followed Muhammad closely in third and fourth places. No other Muslim names showed up in the list of 20 names published by the newspaper.</p>
