        <p>Front, the Swedish collective named Designer of the Future for Design Miami/Basel 2007, will introduce its new Magical! furniture at the fair, which begins Tuesday in Basel, Switzerland. The collection includes the Balancing chair, below left, which appears to defy gravity by resting on a single leg, although when you sit on it all four legs touch the ground. (The secret lies in the plate of steel anchoring the chair to the floor, connected to the leg with a spring; because it is shaped like the chair's shadow, your eye passes over it.) The Levitating lamp, below right, has a shade that seems to float in mid-air. (It actually hangs from the ceiling on thin wire; the light comes from a bulb in the top of the base.) For information on other exhibitions at the fair, which runs through June 16: designmiami.com.</p>
