        <p>There are more than 50 new items in the architect Frank Gehry's housewares collection for Tiffany &amp; Company, all recognizably Gehry-esque in their sweeping sculptural forms. Beyond that, though, the aesthetic range is wide -- as is the range of prices. Some pieces come in jewel-like Murano glass (the red and blue Flux bowls, top right, are $1,650 and $2,200), while others are sterling silver, inspired by crumpled paper but priced much higher (the Torque Object, right, is $25,000). The Leaf platters in bubinga wood and sterling silver are more costly still (the 14-inch wood version, top, is $25,000, and the six-inch silver one is $50,000). Mr. Gehry's personal favorites -- because of the ''basic grid pattern,'' he said, and the ''simple but commanding form'' -- are the openwork china and sterling pieces (the Grid Object pictured with Mr. Gehry is $4,500). There is something for smaller budgets, too: the three-inch Rock tumbler, in bone china, is $35. Tiffany &amp; Company, 727 Fifth Avenue (57th Street), (212) 755-8000; 210 North Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif., (310) 273-8880; or (800) 526-0649 to order.</p>
