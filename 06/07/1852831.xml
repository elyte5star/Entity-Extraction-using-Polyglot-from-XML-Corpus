        <p>A woman who represented clients in Family Court without a license to practice law was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to five years' probation. Law enforcement officials said that the woman, Natasha Riley, 44, represented at least seven clients, including minors seeking disposition of criminal charges and parents seeking child custody, charging $300 to $900 per court appearance. At one hearing, law enforcement officials said, Ms. Riley offered an objection couched in a barnyard epithet, raising the suspicions of the judge. Ms. Riley, who pleaded guilty to filing a false instrument, was also ordered to repay her clients $3,267.</p>
