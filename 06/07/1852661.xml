        <p>Good buys abound during Shop the Block, an annual event that takes place today from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., on 53rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The four museum shops on the street -- the two MoMA stores, the shop at the Museum of Arts and Design and the American Folk Art Museum store -- are giving 20 percent discounts on all merchandise to anyone who is a member of any of the museums. In addition, Alice Pickett-Lewis, a rug weaver, will demonstrate her craft on a loom set up outside the American Folk Art Museum. Ms. Pickett-Lewis's colorful cotton rugs, above, which are sold at the museum store, are made from excess material from clothing manufacturers, and come in assorted colors and sizes. They start at $58 for a two-by-three-foot carpet. For information: (212) 265-1040.</p>
