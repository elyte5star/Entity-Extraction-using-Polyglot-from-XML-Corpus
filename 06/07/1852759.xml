        <p>''The Pirate Queen,'' above, the $16 million musical by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, is giving up the ship on June 17, when it will have played only 85 performances and 32 previews. The closing frees the Hilton Theater for ''Young Frankenstein,'' the new Mel Brooks musical, which has been indiscreetly hovering for weeks. Theresa Rebeck (''The Scene'') will make her Broadway debut next season. Her dark comedy ''Mauritius'' is about a couple of half-sisters and a rare stamp collection. It is scheduled to occupy the Manhattan Theater Club's Biltmore Theater, with an opening date set for Oct. 4. The production will be directed by Doug Hughes (''Doubt'') and will star Bobby Cannavale (''Hurlyburly'') and Alison Pill. The inclusion of Ms. Pill puts to rest any speculation that Manhattan Theater Club's critically acclaimed production of ''Blackbird,'' in which she stars, would transfer to Broadway from City Center, where the show will close on Sunday night.</p>
