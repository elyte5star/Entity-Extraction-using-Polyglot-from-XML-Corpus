        <p>All right, seal the border. Then what?</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain has been putting the question to the right-wing critics who have attacked the Senate's immigration bill as a damnable amnesty for illegal aliens. He is aiming mostly at Mitt Romney, his Republican presidential rival, but he could be speaking to anyone in the large, loud chorus of conservatives who are so furious about the immigration compromise they could spit.</p>
        <p>It's a perfectly reasonable question. Once we lock down the southern border, we lock ourselves in with 12 million illegal immigrants. Let's assume we don't want to deport them all, with a forced-resettlement program big enough to empty the state of Ohio. If we don't want another Trail of Tears and don't want anybody legalized, we will have to get rid of these people some other way.</p>
        <p>This is where the rigor of the right turns to mush. Mr. Romney talks as tough as anyone about securing the borders and despising amnesty. He is proud of the way he tried to heap layers of misery on illegal immigrants when he was governor of Massachusetts. He calls the legalization provisions of the Senate bill utterly unacceptable. But he has laid out no alternative.</p>
        <p>At Tuesday night's Republican debate, Mr. Romney had a perfect opportunity to respond to the charge that he has been pandering for votes while offering no solution other than doing nothing, which Mr. McCain memorably condemns as ''silent amnesty.'' Check the transcript: Mr. Romney had no rebuttal.</p>
        <p>If anyone ought to have thought this through, it would be Representative Tom Tancredo, who is running for president as an immigration zealot. He says he hates the bill so much he wants to unseat any senator who votes for it. But his tough talk on Tuesday was almost as fuzzy as Mr. Romney's. His campaign Web site devotes a scant two paragraphs to immigration policy. Take away the quotation from Theodore Roosevelt, and you have just one paragraph, with a single prescriptive sentence: ''The only realistic solution to the problem of illegal immigration is a strategy of attrition, which seeks to reduce the flow of the illegal alien population over time by cutting off the incentive for coming to and staying in America -- most importantly by eliminating the jobs magnet.''</p>
        <p>Attrition is the restrictionists' fallback plan, a wishful equation that with enough enforcement, mass deportation will happen by itself: Misery plus time equals no more illegals. Small-bore ideologues in places like Hazleton, Pa., and Suffolk County, N.Y., have bought into this approach, adding layer on layer of hostile legislation to drive people out.</p>
        <p>The price of this strategy is high -- far more government intrusion into daily lives, with exponential increases in workplace raids, detentions and deportations; continual ID checks for everyone, citizen or not; immigration police at the federal, state, county and local levels; bureaucrats and snoops keeping an eye on landlords, renters, laborers, loiterers and everyone who uses government services or gets sick. The strain on agriculture and service industries would be devastating. And all the things that everyone agrees are the perversities of the status quo -- exploited workers, depressed wages, a huge undocumented population within our borders -- would persist for an indefinite period until the last illegal immigrant goes home.</p>
        <p>The make-'em-suffer, wait-'em-out tactic is shockingly passive. It's a far cry from the comprehensive reform that Mr. McCain supports, which would move decisively to extend a web of lawfulness over the shadow population, signing people up for visas, doing background checks, extracting fines and back taxes and imposing other conditions. Poll after poll shows the American public supporting this assertive, fair-minded approach. But the amnesty-never hard-liners seem determined to drown them out.</p>
        <p>Maybe this country can make undocumented life so miserable as to extinguish all hope in an immigrant's heart. Maybe it can impose and enforce laws with such rigidity as to make America a beacon of hopelessness. But as an immigration policy, it's hard not to see that as delusional. As an expression of American ideals, it's repulsive.</p>
