        <p>Ötzi, the Neolithic iceman whose well-preserved body was found in the Alps in 1991, bled to death after being hit in the back by an arrow, Swiss scientists said. The arrowhead itself had already been found, but new CAT scans show that it cut an artery, causing internal bleeding, according to Frank J. Rühli of the Anatomy Institute of Zurich University. ''A lesion of an artery close to the shoulder has been found, thanks to a CAT scan,'' he said.</p>
