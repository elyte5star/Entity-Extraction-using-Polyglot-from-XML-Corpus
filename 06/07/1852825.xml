        <p>There will be six colts and one filly in Saturday's 139th running of the Belmont Stakes, and it's the filly, the highly rated Rags to Riches, who will be providing much of the intrigue as the 3-1 third choice. New York Racing Association oddsmaker Eric Donovan set the morning-line odds for the race; Joe Drape lists the horses in order of preference and provided the comments.</p>
        <p>PURSE: $1 million guaranteed  DISTANCE: 1 1/2 miles  TRACK RECORD: 2:24 (Secretariat, 1973)  POST TIME: 6:33 P.M. Eastern  WEIGHT: 126 pounds*  TELEVISION: ABC, 5-7 P.M.</p>
        <p>*All horses carry 126 pounds, except Rags to Riches, who carries 121.</p>
        <p>POST: 6  HORSE: Hard Spun  TRAINER: Larry Jones  JOCKEY: Garrett Gomez  ODDS: 5-2  The runner-up in the Derby and the third-place finisher in the Preakness, Hard Spun finally gets to set the moderate pace he wants and will gallop away from this field.</p>
        <p>POST: 3  HORSE: Curlin  TRAINER: Steve Asmussen  JOCKEY: Robby Albarado  ODDS: 6-5  The Preakness champ is ultratalented, but he has done a lot in very little time and it will catch up to him in the last quarter of a mile.</p>
        <p>POST: 7  HORSE: Rags to Riches  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: John Velazquez  ODDS: 3-1  This filly is trying to do what only 2 of 21 others have done in the history of this race, which is to beat the boys. But Hard Spun and Curlin are too good.</p>
        <p>POST: 5  HORSE: Slew's Tizzy  TRAINER: Greg Fox  JOCKEY: Rafael Bejarano  ODDS: 20-1  Victories in the Lone Star Derby, and Lexington Stakes suggest he is improving, but this race is simply too long for this colt.</p>
        <p>POST: 2  HORSE: Tiago  TRAINER: John Shirreffs  JOCKEY: Mike Smith  ODDS: 10-1  He finished seventh in the Derby, and will be flying late here -- but not fast enough to make a difference.</p>
        <p>POST: 1  HORSE: Imawildandcrazyguy  TRAINER: Bill Kaplan  JOCKEY: Mark Guidry  ODDS: 20-1  The Derby's fourth-place finisher will also come from the clouds. And again it will not matter.</p>
        <p>POST: 4  HORSE: C P West  TRAINER: Nick Zito  JOCKEY: Edgar Prado  ODDS: 12-1  He has won once in six attempts, and is not bred at all for this grueling marathon.</p>
