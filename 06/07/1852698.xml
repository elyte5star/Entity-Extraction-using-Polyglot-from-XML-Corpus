        <p>Frank Gehry, the architect known for buildings adorned with undulating banners of titanium, is set to make his first foray into the world of monkey bars and swings with a new playground at Battery Park, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday.</p>

        <p>Frank Gehry, the architect known for buildings adorned with undulating banners of titanium, is set to make his first foray into the world of monkey bars and swings with a new playground at Battery Park, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The playground's design, which will transform an aging, underused expanse of gray-pebbled concrete, is to be unveiled this year, city officials said, and will include an environmentally friendly restroom building with a planted roof and walls.</p>
        <p>''Everything Frank Gehry touches is unique, and I'm sure it will be a great park,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference yesterday.</p>
        <p>The playground is part of a larger redevelopment of the Battery, which includes a bikeway connecting the East and West sides of Manhattan, gardens and the restoration of Castle Clinton, a fort that later became an opera house and an immigration station. The city has set aside $4 million to build the playground, with the Battery Conservancy, a nonprofit group, planning to raise whatever additional funds are needed.</p>
        <p>The project, which Mr. Bloomberg first announced at a conservancy gala on Tuesday night, is getting under way as the city has moved to reimagine and redesign its public spaces. Although Mr. Bloomberg said it was unlikely the city would see prominent architects designing a rash of playgrounds because of the special requirements involved, there were others, like one near South Street Seaport that is being created by David Rockwell, best known for adult play spaces like the Mohegan Sun casino and resort.</p>
        <p>Warrie Price, president of the conservancy, said that Mr. Gehry, who was unavailable for comment yesterday, was seeking to do something as a gift to the city and began discussing the project about a year ago, through a mutual friend.</p>
        <p>Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner, said that Mr. Gehry's interest was part of a trend toward more adventurous architecture in public and private projects that the administration has encouraged. He added that the one-acre playground, now in the shadow of the Staten Island Ferry terminal, was originally intended just for people passing through, but would be rebuilt to accommodate the growing residential population of Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>How it will all go over with the swing set remains to be seen. But Josh Kammer, 10, who was visiting with his father from Miami yesterday, offered a simple solution to the present playground's shabbiness. ''If this park had a little more grass,'' he said, ''it'd look nicer and attract more people, maybe.''</p>
