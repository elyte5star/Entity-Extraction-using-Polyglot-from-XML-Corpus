        <p>CYCLISTS looking to travel with a bicycle or two face the challenge of how to safely cart them, without damaging the car or their precious cargo. Racks that attach to the back hitch under the bumper are one solution. Sport utility vehicles, station wagons and trucks typically come standard with hitches, with either a 1.25- or 2-inch-diameter receiver.</p>
        <p>Hitch racks are better for a car's aerodynamics than roof racks. And unlike carriers strapped to the trunk, empty hitch racks usually don't have to be removed from the vehicle to access the back of the car. Raxter Racks, a two-year-old company in Broken Arrow, Okla., sells only hitch racks, and its sales have increased about 300 percent since last year.</p>

        <p>''Hitch racks are stable, secure and easy to use,'' said Mike Farney, the founder.</p>
        <p>Josh Simonds, a bicycling coach with the Peaks Coaching Group based in central Virginia, toted bikes on five hitch racks recently.</p>
