      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A federal judge has extended a stay of deportation for Sameh Khouzam, an Egyptian Coptic Christian who faces repatriation for a murder charge in Egypt. Mr. Khouzam, 38, of Lancaster, Pa., was to be deported June 7, but deportation has been stayed until June 18, court documents show. Mr. Khouzam fled to the United States nine years ago, claiming that he had been detained and tortured because he refused to convert to Islam. He denies the murder accusation. In 2004, a federal appeals court allowed Mr. Khouzam to remain in the United States because it determined that he would quite likely face torture if he returned to Egypt. After being freed from detention in 2006, Mr. Khouzam was detained again May 29, after the Egyptian government provided diplomatic assurances that he would not be tortured.</p>
