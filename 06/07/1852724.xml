        <p>When the wee home audio gremlins invade your home at night to change your wireless settings and turn up your TV, they will be quite enamored with the Sony DAV-IS10 audio system and its five tiny speakers. The system also includes a larger subwoofer, a DVD/CD player and a radio receiver.</p>
        <p>How small are the 50-watt satellite speakers? Sony says they are about as big as a golf ball (about 2 inches high). The receiver/DVD player is roughly 8.5 inches by 18 inches by 4 inches high, about the size of a few hardback books. The device is compatible with Sony's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth audio streaming adapters and its TDM-IP1 iPod dock.</p>

        <p>The DVD player can improve standard DVDs for viewing on higher-resolution 1080i screens, and it can connect to high-definition TVs that accept HDMI inputs. It does not read Blu-ray or HD DVD discs.</p>
        <p>The system, which will be available next month priced at $800, has a remote control that is compatible with Sony Bravia television sets and a tuning microphone to help with positioning the tiny speakers in any room.</p>
