        <p>Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said at a conference in Beijing that Hong Kong had considerable autonomy only because the central government had chosen to authorize that autonomy. Under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, China promised Britain that as part of the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule China would preserve ''a high degree of autonomy'' for the territory. But Chinese officials focus these days on the Basic Law, a Beijing-drafted document that serves as Hong Kong's mini-constitution and gives broad powers to the Standing Committee in Beijing to set policy in Hong Kong by interpreting the territory's laws. Mr. Wu spoke ahead of the 10th anniversary on July 1 of Hong Kong's return to China.</p>
