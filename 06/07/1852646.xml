        <p>THE prospect of rocking to Li'l Anne and Hot Cayenne and savoring boiled crayfish and grilled alligator sausage sent visitors in streams last week to Michael Arnone's Crawfish Festival, where they peeled off their shirts -- and their citified ways. The crowd at the Sussex County Fairgrounds in Augusta, N.J., swapped a buttoned-down style for one best described as country-festive, showing off straw hats, riotously colorful bandanas and meadow-sweeping patchwork skirts.</p>
        <p>The unseasonably sultry day prompted men to strip to their dungarees, their air-cooled look accented with beads, snap-brim, and baroque tattoos -- or, in the case of Jayde Gouveia-Hernandez (below), a set of dreds lovingly tended with beeswax.</p>

        <p>Women complemented tank tops and swirling skirts with ruby pumps and visor caps. Autumn and Alison Davidson (below right), bought caps at the fairgrounds, flipping them sideways because, as Alison, right, explained, ''that's gangsta style.''</p>
