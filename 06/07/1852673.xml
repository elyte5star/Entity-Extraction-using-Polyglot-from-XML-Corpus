        <p>7 P.M. (Cartoon Network) CLASS OF 3000 -- André Benjamin, a k a André 3000 of the hip-hop group OutKast, lends his voice to Sunny Bridges in the second season of this vaguely autobiographical animated series about a star who gives up everything to teach a group of musical prodigies in Atlanta. In tonight's episode the students decide to replace all their teachers with celebrities, since things are going so well with Sunny.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) FAST CARS &amp; SUPERSTARS: THE GILLETTE YOUNG GUNS CELEBRITY RACE -- Six top Nascar drivers will teach 12 thrill-seeking celebrities how to streak across the finish line in this new reality series, which will end with a time-trial race: the stars behind the wheel, the Young Guns coaching from the pits. Wearing their Nascar colors: Jimmie Johnson, Ryan Newman, Carl Edwards, Kasey Kahne, Kurt Busch and Jamie McMurray. Among their willing pupils: the singer Jewel and her boyfriend, the rodeo champion Ty Murray; William Shatner; John Elway; Serena Williams; the skateboarder Tony Hawk; and the surfer Laird Hamilton and his volleyball-playing wife, Gabrielle Reece.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE -- The real competition begins as the 20 finalists (10 women and 10 men) start hoofing their way to the $250,000 prize after enduring Hell Week, in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Speed) PAYBACK -- In this custom-car series, celebrities give back to friends who helped them on their ascent. Tonight Robert Downey Jr. says thanks to his best buddy and assistant with a tricked out Hummer H3.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) AMERICAN CHOPPER -- After building a custom bike for Russell Crowe while on their family vacation to Australia, the Teutuls of Orange County Choppers immerse themselves in Aboriginal culture.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (USA) THE STARTER WIFE -- As in starting over. Last week we met Molly Kagan (Debra Messing), the buffed-and-Botoxed Hollywood spouse dumped for a barely postpubescent pop star, and left her kissing a handsome stranger (Stephen Moyer) after being stood up by her date, who just happened to be her ex's boss, Lou (Joe Mantegna). Lou was presumably floating somewhere in the Pacific while the ex, Kenny (Peter Jacobson), gave bad advice to Molly's friend Cricket's husband, Jorge (Aden Young), who had just slept with the Russian nanny. The story continues in this six-episode mini-series adapted from the novel by Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of the producer Brian Grazer.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (NBC) STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP -- Jordan (Amanda Peet) is rushed into surgery, and the situation with Tom's (Nathan Corddry's) brother grows more dire.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (MTV) NICK CANNON: WILD N' OUT -- Mr. Cannon, left, and a cast of comedians including Affion Crockett, Cameron Goodman, Christine Lakin, Corey Holcomb, DeRay Davis, Katt Williams and Dominique bring on more one-liners and improv raps. At 10:30 Mr. Cannon continues his hip-hop spoof of television news reports, commercials and celebrities in ''Nick Cannon: Short Circuitz,'' back from hiatus.</p>
