        <p>Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about Mark Harris, who wrote the baseball novel ''Bang the Drum Slowly'' and other books, gave an incorrect identification in some copies for the actor who played catcher Bruce Pearson in a 1956 television adaptation of that novel. He was Albert Salmi -- not George Peppard, who played another ballplayer, Piney Woods, in the production. The obituary also misidentified a university at which Mr. Harris taught. It was Arizona State University, not the University of Arizona.</p>
