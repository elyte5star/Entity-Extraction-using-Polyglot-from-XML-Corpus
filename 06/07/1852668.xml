      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>David Ives's ''Time Flies &amp; Others by Ives'' is popular among acting students, and it's not just because the amusing collection of compact one-acts features comic roles perfect for performers who love to show off. Receiving a spirited production by the director Jordana Kritzer, this show also speaks quite sympathetically to people struggling to make a way for themselves. They are comedies that embrace the little guy -- or, in the case of the first playlet, the little fly.</p>
        <p>''Time Flies'' is a sweet romance about two angst-ridden mayflies who discover in the middle of their first date that their life span is only about one day. That doesn't leave much time for foreplay. It's a play that truly tests the old cliché: Live every day as if it's your last.</p>

        <p>David Ives's ''Time Flies &amp; Others by Ives'' is popular among acting students, and it's not just because the amusing collection of compact one-acts features comic roles perfect for performers who love to show off. Receiving a spirited production by the director Jordana Kritzer, this show also speaks quite sympathetically to people struggling to make a way for themselves. They are comedies that embrace the little guy -- or, in the case of the first playlet, the little fly.</p>
        <p>''Time Flies'' is a sweet romance about two angst-ridden mayflies who discover in the middle of their first date that their life span is only about one day. That doesn't leave much time for foreplay. It's a play that truly tests the old cliché: Live every day as if it's your last.</p>
        <p>The nervous Horace (Jordan Coughtry) and awkward May (Amy Broder) are lovable types, and the winning performers throw themselves into these roles, balancing Mr. Ives's gentle absurdist tone with his Borsht Belt sensibility. (''It was larva at first sight.'')</p>
        <p>The most moving performance of the evening is delivered by the deadpan Nathan Kaufman in ''Degas, C'est Moi,'' a day in the life of a deluded husband who wakes up one morning and decides that he is the French Impressionist painter Edgar Degas. That he knows little about Degas doesn't deter him. And why should it? He would respond defiantly, ''I am Degas!''</p>
        <p>Like ''Time Flies'' this is another empathetic story that preaches that it's better to appreciate what you have than despair about what you don't.</p>
        <p>Occasionally you wish that Mr. Ives's prose had a bit more bite, but Ms. Kritzer keeps the jokes coming fast enough to distract the audience from lumbering metaphors or any excess displays of sentiment. Some of the shorts that require sustained theatrical hamming -- including ''Mystery at Twicknam Vicarage,'' a Charles Ludlam-like sendup of a British murder mystery, and ''Dr. Fritz, or: The Forces of Light,'' a terrible doctor story -- seem a bit strained in this production.</p>
        <p>But the same cannot be said of ''Babel's in Arms,'' a hipster spin on an old biblical story that follows the blue-collar workers contracted to build the Tower of Babel. Their concern isn't the arrogance of man in the face of God so much as the monumental labor. Think about it: Building a tower to God can't be good for your back.</p>
        <p>''Time Flies &amp; Others by Ives'' continues through July 9 at the Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444.</p>
