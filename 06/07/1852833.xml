        <p>A Bronx man has been arrested and charged with six counts of robbery in connection with a series of robberies on subway trains, the police said yesterday. The man, Miguel Ortiz, 27, of Morris Avenue, was arrested about 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday after a woman exited a No. 2 train at the Wall Street Station and told a police officer that a man on the train had just stolen her necklace and pocketbook. When officers stopped the train at 14th Street, another woman told them that a man had just robbed her. After his arrest, the police said, Mr. Ortiz was also charged with robbing women on other trains and at 109th Street in Manhattan.</p>
