        <p>The Emerson String Quartet knows how to give itself a party, and how to turn a composer's quartet cycle into a high-concept marathon. Its Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall -- an expansive look at the Beethoven quartets, juxtaposed with works by composers who influenced him and felt his influence -- is part of the group's celebration of its 30th anniversary.</p>
        <p>For those of us who remember when the Emerson was a hot young quartet fresh out of the Juilliard School, it's hard to think of this group as having had a three-decade run. Through most of that time it has retained its freshness and vigor, although at a Mendelssohn series at Zankel Hall in 2005 its sound seemed uncharacteristically frayed. The Emerson appears to have come through that rough patch. In the third of its Perspectives concerts, on Tuesday, the energy and sparkle of its early sound were back.</p>

        <p>The Emerson String Quartet knows how to give itself a party, and how to turn a composer's quartet cycle into a high-concept marathon. Its Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall -- an expansive look at the Beethoven quartets, juxtaposed with works by composers who influenced him and felt his influence -- is part of the group's celebration of its 30th anniversary.</p>
        <p>For those of us who remember when the Emerson was a hot young quartet fresh out of the Juilliard School, it's hard to think of this group as having had a three-decade run. Through most of that time it has retained its freshness and vigor, although at a Mendelssohn series at Zankel Hall in 2005 its sound seemed uncharacteristically frayed. The Emerson appears to have come through that rough patch. In the third of its Perspectives concerts, on Tuesday, the energy and sparkle of its early sound were back.</p>
        <p>Having spent the opening concert tracing Beethoven's roots in Haydn and Mozart, the Emerson looked to his successors in the third installment. That journey will eventually lead to Wolfgang Rihm and Kaija Saariaho, but this first step was more modest: Beethoven's Quartet in F (Op. 59, No. 1) was surrounded by works of Mendelssohn and Schubert, composers who shared his musical language, untroubled by theories of modernist harmony and rhythm.</p>
        <p>The Emerson found deeper links as well. The Quartet in F builds on Beethoven's signature technique of transforming short motifs into full-fledged themes mainly through the power of suggestion. The fragments are repeated so often and developed so fully that they seem like themes, even if they last only a bar or two.</p>
        <p>Schubert used that technique amply in ''Death and the Maiden'' Quartet (D. 810), along with more characteristic melodic flights. And Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 2 (Op. 13) is built on motivic cells too, most notably a phrase from his song ''Frage.'' That creates a link to the Schubert, which uses a figure from a song as the basis of its second movement.</p>
        <p>Does this web of connections matter? It could, but it doesn't have to. For the listener who just wants to bathe in the rich sound this quartet brings to Romantic works, programs don't get friendlier. The Emerson took full advantage of that, couching all three works in a warm, finely polished sound and mining them for drama and intensity without ever lapsing into overstatement.</p>
        <p>Solo lines (in Schubert's variations, most notably) sang sweetly, and the group's ensemble -- both in nimble, pianissimo passages like those of the Mendelssohn's Intermezzo, and robust, full-throttle movements like the Beethoven's finale -- could not have been tighter.</p>
        <p>The Emerson String Quartet's Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall continues through June 17. The next concert is tonight.</p>
