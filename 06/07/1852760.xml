        <p>Changing of the Guard At the Phillips Collection  Jay Gates, director of the Phillips Collection in Washington, announced retirement plans yesterday. He will leave when the board appoints a successor, probably next year. Mr. Gates made his announcement exactly nine years after becoming director of the collection, renowned for its Impressionist and Modern American and European Art.</p>
        <p>The Rolling Stones Jam the Roads  Are the Rolling Stones popular in Belgium? A 30-mile traffic jam greeted the band at the start of its European tour in Werchter, Belgium, on Tuesday. While Mick Jagger was starting the performance with ''Start Me Up,'' some of the 33,000 fans were still making their way through the concert grounds after spending hours in the jam caused by the show and worsened by a nearby accident. Besides the big crowd and the big jam, the Stones' act got big praise from Belgium newspapers.</p>
        <p>Fiction Prizewinners Are Announced  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, above, of Nigeria was named the winner yesterday of the $60,000 Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction, and Karen Connelly of Canada the winner of the $20,000 Orange Broadband Award for New Writers. Ms. Adichie was honored for ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' (Fourth Estate) and Ms. Connelly for her novel ''The Lizard Cage'' (Harvill Secker). The awards were announced in London. Ms. Adichie's novel deals with lives caught up in war in Biafra in the 1960s. ''The Lizard Cage'' tells of a protest singer sentenced to 20 years in solitary confinement in Burma. Both prizes were established to celebrate and promote fiction written by women.</p>
        <p>Footnotes  Matthew Ellinger and Michael Hallam have decided to cool it. The two men, involved in a fistfight that interrupted the Boston Pops' season-opening concert on May 9 at Symphony Hall in Boston, withdrew assault and battery complaints against each other at a closed-door hearing on Tuesday in Boston Municipal Court, The Associated Press reported. They will not face charges, a court official said. Walt Disney Studios, the Spider-Man creator Stan Lee and his production company POW! Entertainment have entered a multiyear agreement that will give the studios the first look at any entertainment developed and produced by Mr. Lee and his company. A Stradivarius violin valued at $2.7 million was returned to its owner yesterday, less than a week after it was stolen from the musician's apartment, Austrian authorities announced yesterday. The country's top security official, Interior Minister Günther Platter, personally handed over the violin to the owner, Christian Altenburger, in Vienna. The violin was recovered unscathed, and several members of a Georgian gang were arrested in connection with the theft.</p>
