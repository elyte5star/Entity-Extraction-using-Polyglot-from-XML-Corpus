        <p>IF you are tired of the same old teak or wrought-iron outdoor furniture, this is the summer to redecorate. Many designers are offering patio and garden furnishings in unexpected materials like recycled plastic and porcelain, and some of the new designs add not just comfort but also bright color to the yard. Most of the pieces shown here can withstand the weather, and many of them would look as nice inside as out.</p>
        <p>1. Emu's steel and sheet metal Round Chair ($270) and the Heaven glass and steel table, 47 inches in diameter and 29 1/2 inches high ($1,850), at Property, 14 Wooster Street (Canal Street), (917) 237-0123.</p>
        <p>2. Botanist tables come in powder-coated bent aluminum (in various colors, with or without water-jet cut floral patterns) and also in wood veneer (without cutouts), and three sizes: 20 inches high by 20 by 26 inches ($690 to $866); 15 inches high by 25 by 50 inches ($1,356 to $1,817); and 19 inches high by 18 by 60 inches ($1,200 to $1,611). For stores: (213) 972-9922 or orange22.com.</p>
        <p>3. Studio JSPR's Plastic Fantastic Softskin (or rubberized) club chair is available in a choice of bright colors; $3,600 from Designfront, 21 E. Front Street, Red Bank, N.J., (732) 741-0955 or designonfront.com.</p>
        <p>4. The Peg Chair ($1,850), by Finn Stone, a London-based designer, resembles an old-fashioned clothespin but is made of fiberglass. For information: (011) 44-208-889-3856 or finnstone.com.</p>
        <p>5. I Was Here, a recycled-plastic ''lumber'' table, has graffiti scratched into its surface. Made by Jason Miller, a Brooklyn designer, it comes in blue, black, white, light gray, dark gray and brown. The 50-by-30-inch dining table is $1,500; the 21-inch-square, 17-inch-high side table is $400; and the 50-by-14-by-17-inch-high bench is $700; from the Future Perfect, 115 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-6278.</p>
        <p>6. The weather-resistant felted acrylic ottoman comes in a choice of patterns; $550 from Liora Manné, 210 11th Avenue (24th Street), (212) 989-2732 or lioramanne.com.</p>
        <p>7. John Reeves, a Vietnam-based British designer, created the 18-inch-tall Cadiz porcelain stool ($550) and coordinating table, which has a porcelain base and a 36-inch-square teak top ($1,625). For information: Next Door Trends, (510) 236-1482 or nextdoortrends.com.</p>
        <p>8. Timber, a cast-resin stool or end table shaped like a wood stump, is 17 inches high and 21 inches in diameter on top ($295 in white or dark brown, $565 in bronze metallic); custom colors are also available, at different prices, from Fleetwood Fixtures, the manufacturer, (312) 640-1606 or fleetwoodfixtures.com.</p>
