        <p>They lurked in the woods, 50 strong, wearing black hoods and bandannas, and wielding tree limbs. At a signal, they sprang forward and threw their debris across one of the bigger roads here, creating a barricade that brought traffic to a halt.</p>
        <p>That little insurgency, and dozens like it, kept tensions high on the first day of the Group of 8 meeting in northern Germany on Wednesday. Several thousand protesters clashed with riot police officers, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking roads and railways leading to the site of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Eight police officers were injured, and 15 demonstrators were detained, a police spokesman, Lüdger Behrens, told Reuters. He said the police used force after being pelted with stones.</p>
        <p>While the protesters had little effect on the leaders of the top industrialized nations -- who were flown by helicopter from Rostock to the meeting in the Baltic Sea resort of Heiligendamm, several miles from here -- they did manage to foil the elaborate security precautions of the police.</p>
        <p>The police had erected a $17 million, 8-foot-high, 7.5-mile-long fence topped with barbed and razor wire, completely cutting off the resort, and banned protests within 200 yards of the fence. By midday, though, an estimated 10,000 demonstrators -- many in clown makeup and tinted wigs -- had penetrated the restricted zone and massed at the fence.</p>
        <p>Evading checkpoints by crossing through farmers' fields, protesters also blocked main roads leading from the Rostock airport to Heiligendamm. After numerous standoffs, some lasting several hours, riot police officers clad in helmets waded into the crowd, occasionally swinging truncheons.</p>
        <p>Organizers of the protest complained that the police response was heavy-handed, perhaps because a demonstration on Saturday in Rostock had turned violent and resulted in at least 400 police injuries.</p>
        <p>''It's not just the demonstrators who are being aggressive,'' said Monty Schädel, a local organizer of the protests. ''It's the police who are escalating the trouble with their own aggression.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schädel expressed regret for the violence in Rostock. The majority of anti-globalization protesters, he said, were peaceful. They come from a wide array of social activist groups, including Attac, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and the Global Call to Action Against Poverty.</p>
        <p>But some of them, often those wearing the black hoods, are determined to disrupt the meeting, which they regard as illegitimate. At one point, the protesters forced the police to close all the entrances to Heiligendamm.</p>
        <p>''I'm here because this so-called democratic meeting is not democratic,'' said Lars, a 27-year-old German who declined to give his last name, for fear of arrest. ''I didn't want to just sit and do nothing about it.''</p>
        <p>As a phalanx of riot police officers advanced toward Lars, he and his friends retreated. Earlier, they said, they had been in a clash in which several demonstrators were roughed up. In a nearby field, three protesters sat under the gaze of police officers, their hands cuffed behind their backs with plastic bands.</p>
        <p>The German authorities expected trouble at this meeting, which has become an annual flash point for anti-globalization groups. The authorities spent more than $130 million on security, marshaling 16,000 police officers and 1,100 soldiers in what officials say is the most extensive such operation for a single event in Germany since World War II.</p>
        <p>Last month, the police conducted a nationwide raid of the homes and offices of left-wing campaigners whom they suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting. At the time, the raid was sharply criticized by some opposition leaders, who said it was bullying and disproportionate.</p>
        <p>Public sentiment has shifted, however, since the violence in Rostock. The police had talked about a strategy of ''de-escalation,'' which would defuse tensions between the police and the protesters. On Wednesday, a police spokesman said the de-escalation strategy had come to an end.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed sympathy for the police, saying to reporters that they ''have my full support; it's not an easy job.'' She said meetings like the Group of 8 were ''legitimate'' exercises.</p>
        <p>So far, the protests have mostly inconvenienced the news media. Journalists were forced to travel to Heiligendamm from the neighboring village of Kühlungsborn by boat, after the rail line was blocked.</p>
