        <p>In 1981, Rupert Murdoch and a division of his News Corporation made extraordinary promises about not meddling in the news pages of The Times of London and The Sunday Times, which they were about to take over. But in short order, no one doubted who was firmly in control of the newsrooms.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Murdoch has his sights set on Dow Jones &amp; Company and its centerpiece, The Wall Street Journal. But the Bancroft family, owners of a controlling interest in the company, along with their advisers and Dow Jones officials, are trying to come up with a stronger system for keeping the newsroom independent of Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, London isn't the best example, so we're trying to come up with something more airtight, but we're starting from scratch,'' a family member said yesterday. Like his relatives and family advisers, he was given anonymity because he was not authorized to speak.</p>
        <p>The Bancrofts want to create an editorial board with the power to hire and fire The Journal's top editors, but Mr. Murdoch spurned their initial proposal in their face-to-face meeting on Monday. Family members have conferred about their options since then, and it is a sign of how seriously they take the issue of editorial independence, that the purchase price was not discussed in the meeting with Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>''The whole idea the family is pursuing is unprecedented, so far as I know, in its specificity and its strength,'' said Ben H. Bagdikian, a former assistant managing editor of The Washington Post and former dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>''I'm not aware, except for The Times of London, of any instance of a major paper granting really mandatory powers over the content of the paper, independent of the owner. And in London, of course, it didn't work.''</p>
        <p>What the Bancrofts are trying is all the more unusual in that they want to prevent Mr. Murdoch from dictating not only to the newsroom, but also to The Journal's editorial page, whose conservatism mostly matches Mr. Murdoch's own politics. Editorial pages are typically seen as reflections of the beliefs and interests of the owners of the paper.</p>
        <p>After weeks of silence on the Murdoch bid, the Journal editorial page weighed in yesterday -- not taking a position on its potential new owner -- but arguing in favor of its own continued independence.</p>
        <p>The long, lead editorial read in part ''our owners have allowed us to speak our mind on behalf of a consistent set of principles.''</p>
        <p>''Readers may like, or loathe, those beliefs and our way of defending them. But we like to think this brand of independence is one reason The Journal has attracted such an influential readership.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bagdikian said that in all news media ''there is a strong history of owners and publishers dictating the editorial stance, but The Journal is a rarity in having this very conservative editorial page that was quite independent of the rest of the paper and the ownership.''</p>
        <p>The family has not yet debated whom they might name to an editorial control board, according to family members -- they say it is premature until they have a deal with Mr. Murdoch -- but others close to them have.</p>
        <p>Family advisers say that the obvious approach would be to choose some of the biggest names in American journalism from outside Dow Jones, or respected figures from within the company, or both -- and to focus on retirees who no longer have a financial or competitive stake in the selection.</p>
        <p>Some of the names that have been floated by advisers include Paul E. Steiger, the former managing editor who is now The Journal's editor at large, and Peter R. Kann, the former star reporter who became chief executive and chairman of Dow Jones. Others include former top editors of major newspapers, like John Carroll of The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun, Benjamin C. Bradlee of The Washington Post and Joseph Lelyveld of The New York Times. Others have suggested editorialists or columnists who would reflect something of The Journal's editorial page outlook, like the former Times columnist William Safire.</p>
        <p>Several top officials of the newspaper, including L. Gordon Crovitz, the publisher; Marcus W. Brauchli, the managing editor; and Paul A. Gigot, the editorial page editor, have drafted a proposal for an editorial control structure, and family advisers outside Dow Jones have made their own suggestions.</p>
        <p>Because of his involvement, Mr. Brauchli, who took over just last month as the top newsroom editor, has been recused from overseeing The Journal's coverage of the Murdoch bid; that task has gone to his predecessor, Mr. Steiger.</p>
        <p>Even before the News Corporation bought The Times of London and Sunday Times, their parent company, Times Newspaper Holdings, had ''independent national directors'' who held some of the seats on the board and who were beyond the control of the company's ownership.</p>
        <p>The board could hire or fire the top editors of the papers. Such action required a vote of the majority of the independent directors, as well. The editors were to have sole control over newsroom management and newspaper content, and the owner was not to make suggestions to any journalists except the top editors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch agreed to preserve that system in London, and to allow the independent directors to name their own successors. But within a year, Mr. Murdoch had managed to force out his top editor, Harold Evans, in part through his control of budgets, and soon he was seen by many newsroom employees as having unfettered control over the selection of editors and considerable influence over the content of the news pages.</p>
        <p>Since making his $5 billion offer for Dow Jones, Mr. Murdoch has said he will not spend that kind of money without having true control of the company and all its components. He has offered a system like that he adopted in London, and News Corporation officials say he would want some say over the membership of an editorial control board; the Bancroft family is opposed to that.</p>
        <p>The debate among the Bancrofts over the bid has been hampered by rivalries, tensions and mistrust among branches and individual members of the family, particularly after a heated e-mail message from one of them, William C. Cox III, to some of his relatives, was leaked to The Journal several days ago.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's freaked out about putting anything in writing like Bill did because you don't know who will end up seeing it,'' a family member said.</p>
