        <p>A city employee who was supposed to check the purity of New York City's drinking water was charged in Federal District Court yesterday with making false entries in official water-monitoring records. The man, Nicholas Miritello, 44, of Wappingers Falls, is charged with four instances of recording test results in 2005 on the cloudiness of water that he had not actually tested, federal prosecutors said. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. The Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the water system, has been under federal oversight since 2001 because of similar record-keeping irregularities and other violations of federal law.</p>
