        <p>The Icon mobile manager has just about everything you would expect in a hand-held organizer, including a calendar, address book, clock, word processor, calculator, voice recorder, and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. What it does not have is a screen, because this pocket-size device from LevelStar was designed for visually impaired users.</p>
        <p>With its 30-gigabyte hard drive, the Icon can also store and play audiobooks, podcasts and digital music. An audio-based Web browser and an e-mail program are included in the suite of installed software. The Icon weighs about 7.4 ounces, but carries a laptoplike price tag; it sells for $1,395 at www.levelstar.com and can also be ordered by calling toll free at (800) 315-2305.</p>

        <p>The Linux-based Icon, which comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, runs on an Intel 520-megahertz XScale processor and has 256 megabytes of internal flash memory, along with a MiniSD card slot to add more storage. LevelStar is also at work on a docking station that connects to the Icon and provides a Braille or standard keyboard for data entry, along with a dial-up modem and an Ethernet jack for even more ways to go online.</p>
