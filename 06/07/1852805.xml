        <p>A court in Rome acquitted five people accused of conspiring to murder Roberto Calvi, who was president of Banco Ambrosiano, one of Italy's largest private banks, and a financial adviser to the Vatican when he was found hanged under Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982, his pockets stuffed with rocks, bricks and cash. The presiding judge cited a lack of evidence. The defendants included Giuseppe Caló, known as the Mafia's ''treasurer.'' Prosecutors argued that Mr. Calvi, known as ''God's banker'' because of his Vatican connections, was killed for stealing Mafia money he was supposed to launder. His death was at first ruled a suicide, but the case was reopened in 2003 as a murder inquiry. With yesterday's court ruling, it remains unsolved.</p>
