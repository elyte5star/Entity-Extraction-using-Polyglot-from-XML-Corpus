        <p>Four public housing duplexes are opening in the devastated Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, the secretary of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development announced at a news conference. The secretary, Alphonso R. Jackson, said that more than 100 housing units would be rebuilt in the neighborhood before the end of the year at the New Desire development, on the site of a city housing project that before Hurricane Katrina was being turned into a mixed-income development. Protesters at the news conference said they were representing thousands of former public-housing residents who have been unable to return to the city because, they said, the federal government refuses to reopen even projects that suffered little damage in the storm.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 14, 2007, Thursday  A report in the National Briefing column on June 7 about the opening of four public housing duplexes in New Orleans misidentified their location. It is the Upper Ninth Ward, not the Lower Ninth Ward.</p>
