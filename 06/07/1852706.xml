      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A meeting scheduled for Thursday between the prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has been postponed, largely over what appeared to be the issue of the conditions under which Israel would turn over tax revenues it collects for the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said in a telephone interview from Ramallah that the delay had been requested by the Palestinians because ''the preparations for it have not been completed,'' adding, ''Both sides have an overload of internal and external complexities to deal with.''</p>
        <p>But he also made clear that the Palestinians wanted a meeting that would yield tangible results. ''We stressed that we need some of the tax revenues, which Israel is withholding, released,'' he said, referring to customs and tax funds collected by Israel on the Palestinian Authority's behalf. He added that the Israelis ''are still not coming our way on the tax issue.''</p>
        <p>An Israeli government spokesman, David Baker, said Mr. Olmert was ''certainly willing to meet with President Abbas at any moment.''</p>
        <p>Israel is supposed to transfer the tax revenues to the Palestinian Authority every month but has refused to hand over most of the funds since Hamas, which is defined as a terrorist organization by Israel and much of the West, came to power in elections and formed a government in early 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erekat said the tax revenues collected by Israel constituted 61 percent of the Palestinian Authority's revenues and that without them ''the Palestinian social fabric and institutions are disintegrating.''</p>
        <p>The two leaders had pledged to meet every two weeks at the request of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her last visit to the region, in late March. Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas have held one meeting since then, on April 15 in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>A May meeting was put off after two weeks of fierce violence in Gaza between Palestinian factions and an escalation of hostilities between Palestinians and Israel. Palestinian groups, including Hamas, launched hundreds of rockets at Israel, and the Israeli Air Force retaliated with strikes that it said had been aimed at Hamas military positions and rocket-launching crews.</p>
        <p>As a gesture to the Palestinians, Mr. Olmert's office agreed in principle to hold Thursday's meeting in Palestinian territory for the first time. The usually sleepy West Bank oasis town of Jericho was selected as a likely venue.</p>
        <p>Israeli government officials say the withheld revenues now amount to $566 million.</p>
        <p>During his first meeting with Mr. Abbas, in late December, Mr. Olmert agreed to transfer $100 million to Mr. Abbas's office as a good-will gesture and as part of an effort to strengthen the Palestinian leader, a moderate and the head of the Fatah movement, against the rival Hamas.</p>
        <p>That money was transferred in mid-January, but an Israeli government official, who would discuss the details only on condition of anonymity, said last week that Israel was ''still trying to figure out what happened to the $100 million.''</p>
        <p>The official said Israel wanted Mr. Abbas to create a mechanism that would ensure that the money ''won't be funneled in any way to the Hamas government'' before transferring any more funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erekat pointed to one such mechanism -- a Palestine Liberation Organization account recently set up by Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian finance minister in the new unity government. A political independent, Mr. Fayyad enjoys good relations with the West.</p>
        <p>In a statement on May 30, the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- the so-called quartet working for Middle East peace -- ''commended the excellent work'' of another existing arrangement for Palestinian financing. Known as the Temporary International Mechanism, it was set up by the Europeans to bypass the Hamas government.</p>
        <p>The quartet encouraged Israel and the Palestinian Authority ''to consider resumption'' of the tax transfers via the Temporary International Mechanism ''to improve the economic and humanitarian conditions in the West Bank and Gaza.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli official suggested that the existing arrangements were not satisfactory.</p>
        <p>In Gaza on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Palestinian government, Ghazi Hamad, called Israel a ''thief, stealing the tax money,'' and accused Israel of ''political blackmail.''</p>
        <p>Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said at his briefing on Wednesday: ''We are encouraging both sides to meet. But, in that regard, I think we're pushing on an open door. They both want to meet. And it's just a question of making sure that they make maximum use of all of those opportunities.''</p>
        <p>No new date has been set for an Olmert-Abbas meeting.</p>
        <p>Israeli-Palestinian violence continued Wednesday but at a lower level than in May. A 68-year-old Palestinian man, Yehiya Jabari, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in his house in the West Bank city of Hebron in the early morning hours, and several family members were wounded, Palestinian officials said.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokeswoman said soldiers had visited the house to search for two men and were assaulted by a group of Palestinians, who threw gas balloons and other objects at them. A soldier opened fire after one of the Palestinians tried to grab his weapon, the spokeswoman said. The two wanted men were arrested, she added.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian information minister, Mustafa Barghouti, called the killing a war crime and denied that any arrests had been made.</p>
        <p>Hamas said a member of its military wing, Kamal Saed, had been killed in northern Gaza by an Israeli shell. The army spokeswoman said that the air force had attacked two armed men who were seen planting an explosive device near Israeli forces inside the Gaza Strip and that one had been reported killed.</p>
        <p>The Hamas military claimed responsibility for firing a barrage of mortars at the Erez crossing between Gaza and Israel, saying it was in response to the killing of Mr. Saed. It was the third mortar attack on Erez this week.</p>
