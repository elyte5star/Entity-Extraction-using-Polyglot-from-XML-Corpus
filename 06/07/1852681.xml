        <p>An orchestra festival can aspire to cast new light on a particular composer or period, dust off the familiar and uncover the less known. Or it can be a way to keep its musicians busy.</p>
        <p>The New York Philharmonic's six-part festival ''Brahms the Romantic,'' which began in February, had all the earmarks of a re-examination of a beloved composer. But the final concert, on Tuesday night, smacked of routine: something to be gotten through, like a school exercise.</p>
        <p>That is a sad thing to say about a program that includes the German Requiem. In 2001 the Philharmonic offered the piece in the wake of 9/11 and gave a strong performance that spoke powerfully of loss and mourning. On Tuesday the performance at Avery Fisher spoke of, well, the Tuesday-ness of it all.</p>
        <p>The ingredients were there. The New York Choral Artists offered muted power. The orchestra played competently. The soloists were outstanding: Matthias Goerne, trying valiantly and single-handedly to inject some emotion into the proceedings with his dark, full baritone, and Celena Shafer, a too-seldom-heard soprano. Yet the most tangible connecting thread was the presence of Lorin Maazel, turning the dials to achieve the result he wanted. The result was music that felt manipulated, a surface expression of grief rather than a heartfelt exploration of it.</p>
        <p>In today's vocal country of the blind, Mr. Goerne, outstandingly talented, is a one-eyed king. He has trouble finding worthy musical partners who could help him further focus that talent. His strong and beautiful singing would gain immeasurably in power without the occasional wild eruptions that seem to be part of his concept of expressivity. Ms. Shafer could have used help even more; she wielded her consummately lovely voice with almost deliberate plainness, her foursquare phrasing depriving her solo of the melting, floating quality that can make it a stand-out.</p>
        <p>Instead of emphasizing Ms. Shafer's legato, however, Mr. Maazel brought it out in the orchestra, smoothing out the transitions in both the Requiem and the opening piece, the Variations on a Theme by Haydn, so that one section yielded to another as if varnish had smoothed over the rough edges, and contrasts came within the movements rather than at the outset.</p>
        <p>This in itself might have been more interesting had the playing not been so heavy; Mr. Maazel's ''Romantic'' seemed equivalent, here, to ''lugubrious.'' Brahms the Romantic: heavy, ponderous, and dark, like the furniture of the period. It was hardly an inspiring vision -- or an original one.</p>
