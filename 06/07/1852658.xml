        <p>The Lotus Sanitizing System ($149.99) claims to oxygenate water, turning it into a natural cleanser. At 11 by 14 inches, it may be the bulkiest object on your counter, but the premise is neat: press a button and presto! Oxygenated water, which sucks up bacteria because it has a third oxygen molecule. It had no effect on the mystery stains on my carpet, but on the bathtub it seemed to work as well as Ajax. To test its other application -- nuking the scary things on your food -- I tipped a pint of strawberries into its bowl attachment and let it whir. But how can you tell it's working? Steve Hengsperger, president of Tersano, the company that makes Lotus, pointed me to a number on the box. ''That number is the E.P.A.'s approval of the device as a sanitizer,'' he said. ''Lysol has the same thing.'' Without the nose-singeing smell of bleach or Lysol, it's leap-of-faith territory, but the idea of never buying another bottle of Fantastik or Clorox is appealing.
