        <p>KLIOT--Boris, age 84, born in Riga, Latvia was the only member of his family to survive the Latvian massacres of 1941. He survived four concentration camps and relocated to the United States after the war where he became a successful entrepreneur. As a founder, owner and CEO of Riviera Trading Corporation for over forty years, he was a retail visionary and pioneer in the accessory industry, setting many fashion trends in department chain stores through the United States and Canada. His success as a businessman allowed him to support a number of philanthropic causes. Boris will be forever remembered by his loved ones. He is survived by three sons: Michel with his mother Myra Sterling and his children Tamara and Josh, and Gene and Jason with their mother Jacqueline Kliot, Jason's wife Joana and their two children Hannah and Anton. Boris is also survived by his wife Josette Poux. Funeral Sunday at 11am, Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdan Avenue.</p>
