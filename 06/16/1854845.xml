        <p>Clarkson Cancels Tour</p>
        <p>Kelly Clarkson, the 2002 ''American Idol'' winner, has canceled her summer tour because of disappointing ticket sales, The Associated Press reported yesterday. The cancellation comes as Ms. Clarkson, right, is preparing to release her third album, ''My December,'' due out on June 26. She had been expected to kick off the tour with her performance at the Live Earth concert July 7 in East Rutherford, N.J., and conclude it in Phoenix. Her part in the international Live Earth event is now expected to be her only summer performance.</p>
        <p>Rollins Returns</p>
        <p>The veteran tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, below, announced yesterday that he would perform at Carnegie Hall on Sept. 18, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his first performance there, when he shared the bill with Billie Holiday, Ray Charles and the Thelonious Monk Quartet featuring John Coltrane. Mr. Rollins, 76, will play the three songs he played half a century ago -- ''Moritat,'' ''Sonnymoon for Two'' and ''Some Enchanted Evening'' -- when his sidemen were the bassist Wendell Marshall and the drummer Kenny Dennis. This time, he will play the songs with Roy Haynes on drums and Christian McBride on bass.</p>
        <p>Spice Girls Redux?</p>
        <p>Mel C, the singer known as Sporty Spice who had long opposed a reunion of the Spice Girls, has changed her mind, The Associated Press reported, giving hope to those who want to see the girl group, which broke up in 2001, onstage once more. ''For the first time ever, there is some truth in the rumors,'' Mel C, 33, whose real name is Melanie Chisholm and who now bills herself as Melanie C, told BBC Radio. ''We've been discussing it and it could possibly happen.'' She added that if the Spice Girls reunite, it would be for only a brief time, as ''a final goodbye and a thank-you to all the fans all over the world.''</p>
        <p>More Troubles for Lohan</p>
        <p>Lindsay Lohan, who recently checked herself into a substance abuse rehabilitation facility, is being sued by a Los Angeles man who alleges that the actress crashed her car into his van almost two years ago while she was under the influence of alcohol. The lawsuit by Raymundo Ortega also names the Ivy, a fashionable Los Angeles restaurant, as a defendant, saying the establishment served Ms. Lohan alcohol even though she was under age. The authorities have said that Ms. Lohan did not appear to be responsible for the crash, in Beverly Hills in October 2005.</p>
        <p>The Show Rolls On</p>
        <p>The producers of ''Xanadu,'' the Douglas Carter Beane musical based on the campy 1980 film, have announced a replacement for James Carpinello, who was forced to step aside after suffering a foot injury. Cheyenne Jackson will don the roller skates of Sonny, the leading male role, starting Friday. Mr. Jackson, who wore a pair of blue suede boots as the Elvis-like character in the musical ''All Shook Up,'' had played Sonny in earlier versions of the show. Now in previews at the Helen Hayes Theater, ''Xanadu'' was originally scheduled to open on June 26; a new opening date will be announced early next week.</p>
        <p>Sony Says 'Sorry'</p>
        <p>The Sony Corporation apologized yesterday to the Church of England for a computer game that features a bloody shootout inside an Anglican cathedral, The Associated Press reported. The church had demanded withdrawal of Resistance: Fall of Man, which includes a gun battle between a soldier and aliens inside a building that resembles Manchester Cathedral in northwest England. ''It was not our intention to cause offense by using a representation of Manchester Cathedral,'' said the letter to the Very Rev. Rogers Govender, dean of the cathedral. ''If we have done so, we sincerely apologize.'' A Sony spokesman said the letter included the offer of a meeting with church officials, which Dean Govender said the cathedral would accept. But he underlined the church's opposition to ''the gun violence seen in this portrayal of the cathedral.'' The church was particularly concerned because Manchester has a history of gang-related gun violence. In its letter, Sony said it did not accept any connection between the game and social issues in contemporary Manchester.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>The national tour of the musical ''Spring Awakening,'' which won eight Tony Awards this year including best musical, will begin at the Curran Theater in San Francisco in the fall of 2008, Playbill reported Thursday. The production will be directed by Carole Shorenstein Hays. John Lithgow, below, will make his Royal Shakespeare Company debut in ''Twelfth Night'' in September, the BBC reported yesterday. Mr. Lithgow will play the part of Malvolio in the production, to be staged at the Courtyard Theater in Stratford-on-Avon. The Israeli historian Saul Friedlander will receive the top prize of the annual Frankfurt Book Fair for his narratives documenting the Holocaust, the German Book Trade association said on Thursday. Mr. Friedlander, 74, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, is to be given the $33,000 peace prize during the annual book fair, Europe's largest, in October. Among his best-known works are the two-volume collection ''Nazi Germany and the Jews.'' Previous winners of the award include the Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk and the former Czech president Vaclav Havel.</p>
