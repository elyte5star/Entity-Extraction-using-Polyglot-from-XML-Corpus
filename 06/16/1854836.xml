        <p>The Blackstone Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, is getting ready to go public and its co-founders, Steve Schwarzman and Peter Peterson, are getting ready to cash in on the company they founded 22 years ago with $400,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarzman, 60, will take home as much as $677.2 million, while his remaining 24 percent stake will be worth $7.5 billion if the deal is priced at $30, the middle of the range set by underwriters. (If it goes higher, he will be worth even more.)</p>

        <p>The Blackstone Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, is getting ready to go public and its co-founders, Steve Schwarzman and Peter Peterson, are getting ready to cash in on the company they founded 22 years ago with $400,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarzman, 60, will take home as much as $677.2 million, while his remaining 24 percent stake will be worth $7.5 billion if the deal is priced at $30, the middle of the range set by underwriters. (If it goes higher, he will be worth even more.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Peterson, 81, will get $1.9 billion, which he plans to put in a charitable trust, and will be left with 4 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>Demand is expected to be high for shares in the deal, which could come to market in the next few weeks. But dark clouds are gathering for money-making machines like Blackstone. Two United States senators introduced legislation that could significantly increase taxes on publicly traded private equity firms and hedge funds.</p>
