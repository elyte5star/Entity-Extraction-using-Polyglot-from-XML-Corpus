        <p>President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused Friday to approve a bill that would allow for direct presidential elections, a move that will result in a national referendum on the measure.</p>
        <p>Under the law, Turkey's Parliament chooses the president. But Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pushed to change it, after the country's secular political elite blocked his candidate through legal maneuvering last month.</p>
        <p>The announcement on Friday was posted on the presidential Web site. It said that Mr. Sezer was asking the Constitutional Court to consider the issue. The court is a part of the secular state elite, but does not have the authority to stop the measure.</p>
        <p>Under the current rules, the referendum is likely to be held in October. But Mr. Erdogan's party, Justice and Development, had been trying to change those rules so that the referendum could be held July 22, the day a national election is planned. That initiative is still pending, but requires the approval of Mr. Sezer, who is almost certain to veto it.</p>
        <p>Also on Friday, a bomb in a bicycle basket exploded in the southern city of Diyarbakir, wounding seven people, according to the state-run Anatolian News Agency. Agence France-Presse reported that the bomb detonated near a bus stop where soldiers often wait. Those wounded were expected to survive.</p>
        <p>No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but Turkey's interior minister, Osman Gunes, said the type of bomb and the way the it was set off ''gives an address.'' That was a reference to a Kurdish separatist group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has recently stepped up attacks against the Turkish military.</p>
