        <p>If Bubba Watson were to win the United States Open, he would become the first Bubba in 107 years to do so.</p>
        <p>''I made the cut,'' said Watson, a big-hitting left-hander from the Florida Panhandle. ''If making the cut is a Cinderella story, yeah, I did that.''</p>
        <p>With long drives and a silky short game, Watson had a second-round 71, which left him one shot behind Angel Cabrera going into Saturday's third round. He has already won galleries with his tape-measure tee shots and ready grins.</p>
        <p>From the tiny town of Bagdad, Fla., the 28-year-old Watson has turned storytelling into show time.</p>
        <p>''My parents never had locks on their doors,'' he said after his round. ''My dad is like Tiger's dad, he's a Special Forces Green Beret. He wants somebody to come in. We've never had locks on our doors, so I've never been afraid of anything.''</p>
        <p>How does he think he will stand up in the heat of the most difficult major championship on the calendar?</p>
        <p>''I'm always nervous,'' said Watson, who played the opening two rounds with one of his best friends, Boo Weekley. ''U.S. Open, John Deere, Memphis, it doesn't matter. I'm trying to get my first win. I was nervous in the practice rounds.''</p>
