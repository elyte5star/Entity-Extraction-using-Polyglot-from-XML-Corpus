        <p>A Connecticut man pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter here on Friday in the stabbing death last summer of his Fairfield neighbor who he mistakenly believed had molested his 2-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the man, Jonathon Edington, 30, a patent lawyer who was originally charged with the more serious crime of first-degree murder in the death of his Colony Street neighbor, Barry James, 59, cited ''extreme emotional disturbance'' as a mitigating factor in reducing the charge from first-degree murder.</p>
        <p>The Superior Court judge, Richard F. Comerford Jr., said Mr. Edington faced a maximum prison term of 20 years when he is sentenced on Aug. 17.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Edington's wife, Christina, who telephoned her husband last August from Rhode Island, where she and their two children were vacationing, to say that their older daughter had told her that Mr. James had touched her and exposed himself to her.</p>
        <p>Jonathan C. Benedict, the state's attorney for the judicial district of Fairfield, told the court on Friday that minutes after the call, Mr. Edington ''got a couple of knives,'' walked across the driveway to the house where Mr. James lived with his parents, burst through a screen in a ground-floor bedroom window and repeatedly stabbed Mr. James in the presence of Mr. James's parents.</p>
        <p>Moments later, the Fairfield police said, they found Mr. Edington, his hands and forearms bloodstained, talking on a cellphone in his house. Mr. Edington was charged with first-degree murder and later released on $1 million bail.</p>
        <p>Two days after the stabbing, Ms. Edington filed a complaint with the Fairfield police detailing the possible sexual abuse of her daughter. But on Oct. 19, a Fairfield police captain, Gary McNamara, said an investigation showed that the child had not been molested.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Benedict said that the case ''had certain makings of extreme emotional disturbance'' and that it could be a teaching model in both law and medical school.</p>
        <p>''The twist is this: The Fairfield Police Department concluded it was a bogus complaint; Mr. James had never been in the Edington home and had never molested the child,'' Mr. Benedict said.</p>
        <p>In 2001, Mr. James, who once worked for the town and later was a part-time employee in a local funeral home, was convicted of driving under the influence and sentenced to 18 months' probation.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the Jameses, Richard T. Meehan Jr., said the couple had filed a civil suit against the Edingtons.</p>
