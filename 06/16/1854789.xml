        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Divide in Caring for Our Kids,'' by Bob Herbert (column, June 12):</p>
        <p>The daily suffering by millions of American children from ordinary tooth decay is avoidable. Cavities can be prevented using cost-effective measures already available. Prevention and timely treatment save money and improve children's lives.</p>
        <p>As in the case of Deamonte Driver highlighted by Mr. Herbert, dental care can even save lives. Deamonte's death from consequences of a cavity has captured the attention of Capitol Hill, the press and the public.</p>
        <p>Now is the time to translate this attention into action and to put the policies, programs and resources in place to close the divide so that all children can live their lives free of dental pain and infection.</p>
        <p>The United States surgeon general reports that 80 percent of tooth decay occurs in the mouths of only 25 percent of our children. Yet these vulnerable children are least able to gain access to dental care.</p>
        <p>This problem will be solved when states abide by federal Medicaid law, when more employers provide dependent dental coverage, when dentists reach out to children with the greatest needs, and when policy makers ensure that our nation's future dental capacity is robust enough to meet our needs.</p>
        <p>Burton L. Edelstein  Washington, June 14, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of dentistry and health policy and management at Columbia University and chairman of the Children's Dental Health Project.</p>
