      <abstract>
        <p>Many private equity firms are being questioned over using tax loophole that allows them to operate as partnerships and to pay far lower tax rates than corporations, giving them advantage that critics say is unfair; their partners generally pay no more than 15 percent in taxes on most of money they earn from firm, compared with top individual rate of 35 percent; tax loophole is igniting closed meetings in Congress and introduction of bill aimed at eliminating disparity; amount of taxes at stake is huge, based on rough estimate of earnings of biggest private equity firms; five largest private equity firms control almost $100 billion in assets in their most recent US investment funds; those funds pay taxes of $2.3 billion under current tax code; legislation proposed by Sens Max Baucus and Charles E Grassley could more than double that tax bill to $5.2 billion; Blackstone Group, privately run partnership domninated by Steven A Schwarzman, earned about $1.1 billion before taxes in first quarter, but paid just $14 million, or 1.3 percent, in taxes; photo (L)</p>

        <p>This week, Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's most profitable firm, reported that it earned about $3.4 billion for the second quarter. As always, it set aside a big chunk of money -- $1.1 billion, or about 32 percent -- to pay corporate income taxes on its healthy profits.</p>
        <p>Then there's the Blackstone Group -- the first big-name private equity firm to proceed with plans to go public in the United States -- whose business is similar in many ways to Goldman's.

        <p>This week, Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's most profitable firm, reported that it earned about $3.4 billion for the second quarter. As always, it set aside a big chunk of money -- $1.1 billion, or about 32 percent -- to pay corporate income taxes on its healthy profits.</p>
        <p>Then there's the Blackstone Group -- the first big-name private equity firm to proceed with plans to go public in the United States -- whose business is similar in many ways to Goldman's. In the first quarter, Blackstone, a privately run partnership dominated by Stephen A. Schwarzman, earned about $1.1 billion before taxes. Its tax bill? Just $14 million, or 1.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Even after the Blackstone partners pay their share, the total should still come to less than half that of their Wall Street counterparts.</p>
        <p>The gap is the latest example of an advantage that has existed for decades but gone largely unnoticed -- until now. It has allowed private equity firms, like Blackstone, to operate as partnerships and to pay far lower tax rates than corporations, giving them an advantage that critics say is unfair.</p>
        <p>Moreover, their partners generally pay no more than 15 percent in taxes on most of the money they earn from the firm, compared with the top individual rate of 35 percent.</p>
        <p>Why has this arcane part of the tax code suddenly become a hot-button political issue, igniting a flurry of closed meetings on Capitol Hill and the introduction of a bill on Thursday aimed at eliminating the disparity?</p>
        <p>The answer can be traced to the growing prominence of private equity firms, which are now seeking to tap the public markets at a moment when they are using their vast pools of money to acquire companies from Chrysler to Sallie Mae and take them private.</p>
        <p>Along with that has come a mushrooming of publicity over the staggering wealth being accumulated by their partners and by those who operate hedge funds, which accumulate capital to invest on behalf of wealthy individuals and institutions.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, most partnerships were so much smaller than corporations that the tax advantage did not amount to a particularly large sum.</p>
        <p>''It makes sense for three guys in a garage making something,'' said Victor Fleischer, an associate professor of law at the University of Illinois who met last month with Congressional aides to discuss his research on the tax advantages of private equity firms. ''But when you apply those to a $1 billion investment fund, it doesn't make that much sense.''</p>
        <p>The amount of taxes at stake is huge, based on a rough estimate of the earnings of the biggest private equity firms. The five largest private equity firms control almost $100 billion in assets just in their most recent United States investment funds. If those funds alone generated an annual return of 15 percent -- and many generate much higher returns -- they would earn profits of $15 billion and pay taxes of $2.3 billion under the current tax code.</p>
        <p>The legislation proposed this week by Senators Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who serves as the ranking minority member, could more than double that tax bill to $5.2 billion. That figure would probably be much larger when the assets in previous investment funds are included.</p>
        <p>The proposal would apply to private equity firms, hedge funds and venture capital firms that seek to protect their tax advantage by remaining a partnership after going public.</p>
        <p>The issue started to gain steam this year after the Fortress Investment Group, an alternative asset management company with private equity funds and hedge funds, went public in February and it became clear Blackstone intended to follow.</p>
        <p>In March, Blackstone officials met on Capitol Hill with committee staff members and aides to lawmakers to discuss everything from the taxation of so-called carried interest at the lower capital gains rate to issues surrounding publicly traded partnerships, according to people briefed on the meetings.</p>
        <p>In early May, a closed session was held with staffers from the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, which are responsible for all tax legislation, along with Treasury officials, among others. Mr. Fleischer was there as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer would not comment on the specifics of the meeting, but said he discussed his work. ''This is a huge anomaly,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''We have the richest workers in the world paying a low effective tax rate on their labor.''</p>
        <p>As it became clear that Blackstone's public offering was fast approaching, the professional staff quickly drafted a bill, without any hearings on the subject, surprising everyone from Blackstone to other members of Congress.</p>
        <p>''This is a fundamental misstep in moving legislation in a closely divided Senate,'' one Senate aide said. It is unclear what kind of support, if any, the bill will garner.</p>
        <p>For Blackstone, which is on the road marketing its public offering, the impact could be significant, potentially lowering its valuation by as much as 20 percent. (Such estimates are unclear, however, because even if the bill passed, Blackstone would have until 2012 to comply.)</p>
        <p>Blackstone conceded that the issue could have a material impact on its valuation.</p>
        <p>''If a variation of this proposed legislation or any other change in the tax laws, rules, regulations or interpretations preclude us from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules,'' the company said in a government filing yesterday, ''this would materially increase our tax liability and could well result in a reduction in the value of our common units.''</p>
        <p>Others see a potential chilling effect on private equity seeking to sell shares through the public markets. ''If valuation is the determining factor to go public,'' said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers, ''this could have the effect of discouraging comparable firms from going public.''</p>
