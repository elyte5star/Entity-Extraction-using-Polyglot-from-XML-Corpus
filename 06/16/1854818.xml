        <p>The United States envoy to Kosovo said Friday that Western nations could put off plans to make the province independent of Serbia, if doing so might bring Russia on board.</p>
        <p>The envoy, Frank G. Wisner, met with most of the principal European nations overseeing talks on Kosovo on Tuesday, and told Kosovo's leaders on Friday that the Western nations were willing to foster new talks -- ''not to delay what the outcome has to be, but to make it clear to the world that every avenue was pursued.''</p>

        <p>The United States envoy to Kosovo said Friday that Western nations could put off plans to make the province independent of Serbia, if doing so might bring Russia on board.</p>
        <p>The envoy, Frank G. Wisner, met with most of the principal European nations overseeing talks on Kosovo on Tuesday, and told Kosovo's leaders on Friday that the Western nations were willing to foster new talks -- ''not to delay what the outcome has to be, but to make it clear to the world that every avenue was pursued.''</p>
        <p>The idea, which follows a similar proposal that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France made in recent days, is to allow new talks between Serbia and the ethnic Albanian leadership of Kosovo during the next four to six months. Mr. Sarkozy raised the idea with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, whose country is an ally of Serbia and who opposes independence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy suggested that if the talks failed to reach a resolution, Kosovo would then become independent. But the American desire for Kosovo to gain its independence this summer was set back when Mr. Sarkozy floated his plan.</p>
        <p>In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the French idea had been met with dismay by ethnic Albanian politicians. If the Americans consent to a delay, that would further upset the Albanians. The United States and most of Europe agree that the enclave, whose population is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, needs to be independent after the ethnic fighting of the past decade. But they have been stymied in trying to get a United Nations resolution over Russia's opposition.</p>
        <p>''Kosovo cannot remain a hostage continuously,'' Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-led government, said after he met with Mr. Wisner.</p>
        <p>Serbia indicated it would object to new talks.</p>
