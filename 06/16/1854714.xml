        <p>7:15 P.M. (HBO) THE MUSIC IN ME: A FAMILY SPECIAL -- A bevy of young musicians from around the country, two of whom are pictured above, demonstrate the various cultural traditions they're carrying on. The six featured in this special include an 11-year-old tin-whistle player, a 10-year-old mariachi singer and guitar player, and an 11-year-old classical composer. And two young girls discuss how playing the piano helped them survive cancer.</p>
        <p>5 P.M. (Discovery Kids) BINDI THE JUNGLE GIRL -- In scenes filmed before her father's death, Bindi Irwin, 8, travels with her mom, Terri, and her dad, Steve Irwin, of ''The Crocodile Hunter,'' across the United States to examine the unique character of American wildlife. At 5:30 Bindi works with smaller cats, while her dad and veterinarians in South Africa keep track of lions.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (Animal Planet) ANIMAL PLANET DOG CHAMPIONSHIPS 2007 -- Dogs of every breed compete for the title of best in show in Harrisburg, Pa. Tune in and be grateful that you're not the one who has to look into those puppy dog eyes and decide which pooch is the best.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Oxygen) 50 FUNNIEST WOMEN ALIVE -- Kelly Ripa is the host of a tribute to Whoopi Goldberg, Lisa Kudrow, Jaime Pressly, Chandra Wilson and other women who make us laugh, with video clips of their work.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (VH1) MONTEREY 40 -- Woodstock's name is dropped more often, but the Monterey International Pop Music Festival, held from June 16 through June 18, 1967, heralded the Summer of Love, helped create a new face for rock 'n' roll and laid the groundwork for music festivals to come. This documentary tells its story, with interviews with Paul McCartney, Michelle Phillips, Ravi Shankar, Clive Davis and others. Above, Otis Redding performing at the festival.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (A&amp;E) CONFESSIONS OF A MATCHMAKER -- Some people need a little help with their love lives -- professional help. This new reality series follows Patti Novak, left, a matchmaker in singles-rich Buffalo who is known for her tough-love style. (She is billed as the Simon Cowell of matchmaking.) The premiere features Charlie, who's counting on his former glory to get women past his paunchy physique and bad table manners, and Ashley, who would be quite cute without the heavy makeup and repeated visits to the tanning parlor. At 10:30 p.m. Ms. Novak offers some blunt advice to a 41-year-old virgin.</p>
