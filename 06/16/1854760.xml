        <p>A sports article yesterday about two lawyers indicted in Kentucky on federal charges of conspiring to defraud clients in a $200 million lawsuit settlement with the maker of the diet drug fen-phen omitted the name of a third lawyer who was indicted. Melbourne Mills Jr. was also charged -- but unlike the other two, Shirley A. Cunningham Jr. and William J. Gallion, he was not a part-owner of the Preakness champion Curlin. (Unaware of the sports article, the editors of the National Briefing column ran another one that omitted the lawyers' horse-owning backgrounds.)</p>
