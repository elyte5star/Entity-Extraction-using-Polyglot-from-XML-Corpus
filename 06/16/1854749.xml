        <p>A contractor was shot and critically wounded early yesterday as he walked out of his house in the Whitestone section of Queens, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Boris Grzic, 59, was on his way to work about 7:15 a.m. when an unknown gunman approached him in his driveway and opened fire. Neighbors said they heard several shots and ran outside to find Mr. Grzic lying face down a few feet from the entrance to his two-story brick house at 145-48 17th Road.</p>
        <p>He had been shot once in the head and once in the neck. Paramedics arrived at his house within minutes and took him to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. He was on life support, the police said.</p>
        <p>It was unclear last night what had prompted the shooting. The police said they were investigating the possibility that the shooter was someone angry with Mr. Grzic over a soured business deal.</p>
        <p>Records indicate that Mr. Grzic owns a sizable construction company, Whitestone Construction Corp., in Flushing. According to the company's Web site, Whitestone is doing work at Columbia University, the Children's Hospital of New York and the South Street Seaport Museum, among other projects.</p>
        <p>The police said they were hoping to trace ''ballistic evidence'' they had discovered at the scene of the shooting, but they did not elaborate on what they had found.</p>
