        <p>For more than 50 years the governments of Arizona and its Mexican neighboring state, Sonora, have gathered regularly to strike agreements, pledge cooperation and bask in border bonhomie.</p>
        <p>But meeting here over two days, as border violence and drug trafficking have swelled and the United States Senate considers the most significant changes to immigration law in 20 years, a deep sense of urgency, even anxiety, hung over the proceedings.</p>
        <p>While describing cooperation between the two states as good, Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a Democrat, said she remained concerned about an increase in drug seizures along the border and the recent spate of violence.</p>
        <p>Most alarming, Ms. Napolitano said, was a firefight last month among rival drug cartels and the police in the Sonoran city of Cananea, about 100 miles south of here. Nearly two dozen people were killed.</p>
        <p>Such episodes are more typical in border cities near Texas. Although the violence has not usually crossed into the United States, Ms. Napolitano said in an interview, ''you don't want to run that risk, either.''</p>
        <p>''I hope it is an anomaly,'' she said, ''but I think if it is our goal to have the safest part of the U.S.-Mexican border, then you can't presume that it's an anomaly.''</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials have said weapons used in the fighting have come from the United States.</p>
        <p>Daniel Duran Puente, a spokesman for Eduardo Bours, the Sonora governor, said while ''we hope it won't happen again,'' it was ''a sign of what has been happening in the whole country.''</p>
        <p>He said Sonora had been cracking down on organized crime groups but was seeking more cooperation from the Mexican government on drug trafficking intelligence to thwart violence.</p>
        <p>At the summer meeting of the Arizona-Mexico Commission, there was the usual signing of agreements between two states that figure prominently in any discussion of the border -- Sonora as the principal staging ground for illegal crossers and Arizona as the state that receives more of them than any other.</p>
        <p>To crack down on the financial network that supports human smuggling, Arizona will train Sonora detectives to investigate wire transfers that may be directed to guides, known as coyotes, that bring people over the border. Arizona officials have claimed success in seizing wire transfers suspected of being used to pay smugglers in their state, but they now believe the money is flowing to Sonora to avoid their efforts.</p>
        <p>The two governments also signed agreements to improve radio communication among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies and to more closely track stolen vehicles used in drug and human smuggling on both sides of the border.</p>
        <p>Ms. Napolitano also met privately with officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Border Patrol, which has been reporting an increase in drug seizures, principally marijuana, in the past year along the Arizona border.</p>
        <p>Since October, the Border Patrol has seized 648,000 pounds of marijuana, a 71 percent increase over the previous year, in the Tucson sector, which includes most of the Arizona border. Over the same period, arrests of illegal crossers dropped 10 percent, to 270,000 people.</p>
        <p>Border Patrol officials have attributed both trends to the presence of thousands of National Guard troops who arrived last summer, deterring crossers while freeing up agents to make drug arrests. But they have said there are also indications that shifting drug trafficking patterns and a bumper marijuana crop on the Mexican side may be contributing to the increase.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, Ms. Napolitano said the trends demonstrated a need for more federal drug agents at the border. She said she and Mr. Bours would also continue to address the problems locally.</p>
        <p>''What we did was decide as governors we could not wait all the time and say it is only a federal responsibility to respond,'' she said, listing various task forces and agreements the states have reached in recent years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Napolitano has also been advocating for the comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate.</p>
        <p>She said President Bush's promise of $4 billion in additional money for border security ''will help get Republican votes'' for the measure. Ms. Napolitano had backed the ''grand bargain'' version of the bill that was pulled from the Senate floor last week, and she said she would probably support a new version of the bill.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen what they've changed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome, Ms. Napolitano said Arizona and its border neighbor would continue to forge cultural and economic ties, something the twice-yearly meeting seeks to celebrate and advance. The next meeting is in Sonora in the fall.</p>
        <p>''There is an ongoing relationship that happens even in the midst of an immigration meltdown,'' Ms. Napolitano said. ''I think it's reflective of the fact borders don't need to be -- how do I say this? -- that there are challenges but also opportunities.''</p>
