        <p>The head of an investigation into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, David A. Brown, said in a report that the force's management and operations structure was ''horribly broken.'' Mr. Brown, the former head of the Ontario Securities Commission, was asked by the government to examine how the force had handled allegations that money was misspent by administrators of the pension and insurance fund. He concluded that officers who raised questions had been punished, that those responsible were not held to account and that an ostensibly independent investigation by Ottawa's municipal police force, which found no wrongdoing, was effectively guided by the Mounties. He was particularly critical of the ''autocratic leadership style'' of the Mounties' former commissioner, Giuliano Zaccardelli. Mr. Zaccardelli resigned this year after retracting some of his parliamentary testimony about the case of Maher Arar, the Canadian citizen deported to Syria by the United States after the Mounties provided erroneous information suggesting that he was a terrorism suspect.</p>
