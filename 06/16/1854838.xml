        <p>It appears that the Food and Drug Administration will not clear the pill, Zimulti, for sale in the United States. Zimulti helps people lose 5 percent of their weight, but with a downside. It also seems to bring on emotional problems, including suicidal thoughts, in a population already at high risk for depression: the obese.</p>
        <p>Researchers have long warned that a magic pill for obesity is elusive. Sanofi-Aventis said it would work with the F.D.A. to address concerns about the drug. What's left?

But Alli has side effects likely to deter acceptance, including sometimes causing diarrhea and flatulence.</p>
