        <p>Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates arrived here late on Friday bluntly expressing disappointment with the pace of political reconciliation under Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, even as the final units of the American troop increase were moving into position and bombings threatened to inspire more sectarian violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates, making his fourth trip to Iraq in six months as defense secretary, said his message to the Iraqi leadership would be that ''our troops are buying them time to pursue reconciliation and that, frankly, we are disappointed in the progress thus far.''</p>
        <p>In what appears to be a coordinated campaign by the Bush administration, the defense secretary will be reinforcing a message delivered to the Maliki government in person over recent days by Adm. William J. Fallon, the American commander in the Middle East, and John D. Negroponte, the deputy secretary of state.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gates described his goal as encouraging efforts by the Maliki government in Baghdad, he also expressed a desire to increase cooperation with provincial political leaders and local tribal sheiks.</p>
        <p>He said that ''perhaps we have gotten too focused on the central government, and not enough on the provinces, and on the tribes and what is happening in those areas.'' He said he hoped to spark greater attention to this ''ground-up effort.''</p>
        <p>In comments to reporters before arriving at the American military headquarters on the Baghdad outskirts, Mr. Gates disagreed with recent assessments by Democratic Party leaders in Washington, who said that senior American officers had not accurately described the true, and chaotic, state of affairs in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates said the generals he met ''have been very realistic,'' and he characterized Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior American commander in Iraq, as one who ''has not pulled his punches'' and has the ''ability and willingness to call it like he sees it.''</p>
        <p>The defense secretary cautioned that an official assessment on the impact of the troop increase due in September and ordered by Congress might not present a full picture of the situation in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''There still will be a lot of uncertainty,'' he said. ''But I think we will have some sense of direction and trends.''</p>
        <p>As part of this previously unannounced visit, Mr. Gates said he would discuss with the Iraqis how to make certain that the bombing of a revered mosque in Samarra -- and a feared round of reprisals -- ''won't further disrupt or delay the process'' of political reconciliation.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that Mr. Maliki and his government were facing ''enormous obstacles,'' but he said that the prime minister must do more to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that his government would ''lay the groundwork for a future Iraqi state in which all of the different elements can live in peace with one another.</p>
        <p>''I think the prime minister is trying to address that challenge as well as he can, and I think he deserves our support,'' Mr. Gates said.</p>
        <p>He agreed that the security situation is ''a very mixed picture.'' He urged patience until the fifth and final Army brigade ordered by President Bush to bolster forces in Iraq could begin full operations. That brigade arrived this month.</p>
