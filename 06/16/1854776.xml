        <p>The San Antonio Spurs' sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers produced the N.B.A.'s least-viewed championship, with an average of 9.2 million viewers, as measured by Nielsen Media Research. The previous low, almost 9.9 million, was in 2003 when the Spurs defeated the Nets.</p>
        <p>Game 4 on Thursday night, won by the Spurs, 83-82, attracted 9.8 million viewers, the most for the series. But that was down 16 percent from the comparable game in the Dallas-Miami series last year. The Spurs-Cavaliers attracted less than half the highest-average viewership for the finals this decade -- the 18.9 million who tuned in to see the Los Angeles Lakers beat Philadelphia in five games in 2001.</p>
