        <p>Al Carbone, a Bergen County cabdriver, was nearing the end of his shift about 4 a.m. Friday when a man approached him in the parking lot of the A.&amp;P. here and told him that two children were wandering in front of the supermarket.</p>
        <p>In a quarter-century on the job, Mr. Carbone said, he had never seen anything as troubling as the two sparsely clad toddlers running on the sidewalk ''like they were in their backyard.'' Police later identified them as brothers, one 3 years old, the other 18 months.</p>

        <p>Al Carbone, a Bergen County cabdriver, was nearing the end of his shift about 4 a.m. Friday when a man approached him in the parking lot of the A.&amp;P. here and told him that two children were wandering in front of the supermarket.</p>
        <p>In a quarter-century on the job, Mr. Carbone said, he had never seen anything as troubling as the two sparsely clad toddlers running on the sidewalk ''like they were in their backyard.'' Police later identified them as brothers, one 3 years old, the other 18 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carbone, 74, said the first thing he did was tell his dispatcher to call the police. Then, as he got out of his cab, the two shivering toddlers ran toward him.</p>
        <p>''They weren't dressed at all,'' he said. ''One was in a pajama top and underwear, and the older one had on pajama bottoms, no shirt and a blanket.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carbone said he hoisted the children into the warm back seat of his cab, then tried to ask them where he could find their mother. But, he said, the brothers spoke only ''baby talk.''</p>
        <p>Minutes later, the police arrived and Mr. Carbone said his thoughts again turned to the boys' mother. ''I was cursing, which I don't like to do,'' he said. ''I was calling her all sorts of names.''</p>
        <p>A short time later, the police in neighboring Cliffside Park, who were handling the investigation, said they had arrested the boys' mother, Cindy Enid Cabrera, 24, and charged her with two counts of child endangerment. The children were in the custody of the state's Division of Youth and Family Services on Friday.</p>
        <p>Christos Diktas, borough attorney for Cliffside Park, said the children, who live with their mother in Brooklyn, were visiting friends in the New Jersey town when they wandered out an unlocked or open front door. The A.&amp;P. in Fairview is just across the Cliffside Park town line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diktas said that a 50-year-old woman, whom he identified as a family friend, was asleep in the house, about a block from the A.&amp;P., when the boys left and that their mother was not there at the time. Mr. Diktas did not say where she had been.</p>
        <p>The police said Ms. Cabrera was being held in the Bergen County Jail on Friday in $250,000 bail.</p>
