        <p>The life of a writer bears about the same relation to the work as everyday reality does to a dream. In both cases, a glancing transformation takes place.</p>
        <p>The life of the writer Laura Albert has seemed somewhat mysterious -- at least to the public -- ever since the day last year she was revealed to be the true creative force behind the author JT Leroy, the supposed son of a truck-stop prostitute who wrote the novel ''Sarah.''</p>
        <p>Ever since that revelation, there have been questions, first among them perhaps: How could Ms. Albert, 42, raised in Brooklyn Heights, have written with such emotional exactitude about a West Virginia misfit so in love with his mother that he joins her in giving truckers paid sex?</p>
        <p>The first tentative answer was revealed yesterday when Ms. Albert's own mother, Carolyn Albert, took the witness stand at her daughter's civil fraud trial in Manhattan. A film production company is suing Laura Albert, trying to recoup the money she received for a contract to make a feature film of ''Sarah.'' The company, Antidote International Films Inc., says the contract should be voided, mainly because its signatory, JT Leroy, does not exist.</p>
        <p>Carolyn Albert is a former New York City schoolteacher. She wears glasses, shuffles when she walks and has the sort of shrugging ''Who, me?'' manner that one associates with Brooklyn women of a certain age.</p>
        <p>Under questioning from Eric Weinstein, Laura Albert's lawyer, she told the court her daughter had a deeply troubled childhood marred by absenteeism from school and suicide threats. There was divorce and what she called ''impossible behavior.'' Laura was, in fact, so shy, she could not sit in the same room with a teacher who tutored her at home. Instead, they spoke by phone: the teacher in the living room, Laura in her bedroom, Carolyn Albert said.</p>
        <p>There were two brief stints in psychiatric wards, the first when Laura was 14. The day her mother dropped her at the ward was her birthday. As Carolyn Albert said this to the court, her eyes clouded up, and she began to weep. ''I brought her there on her 14th birthday. I remember thinking, I'm leaving my daughter in a psychiatric hospital. I'm sorry,'' she said. Then her voice trailed off into a wail.</p>
        <p>The jury sat uncomfortably watching the mother cry. They also watched the daughter cry.</p>
        <p>Laura Albert put her head down at the table, and her shoulders shook. The judge looked sympathetic but unhappy. He called the lawyers to a sidebar. He allowed Ms. Albert to leave the room -- ''to ease the psychological situation,'' as he said.</p>
        <p>When the jury returned, Mr. Weinstein asked the mother if Laura had ever socialized as girl, ever left the house?</p>
        <p>''No, not for three years,'' she said. ''She didn't leave her bedroom.''</p>
