        <p>A court clerk in southern New Jersey was dragged into the outer orbit of the Fort Dix terror case this week after she was charged with altering traffic tickets issued to one of the six suspects who have been indicted, the authorities announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the acting Camden County prosecutor, Joshua M. Ottenberg, said the charges against the clerk, Debra H. Benecke, 48, had nothing to do with the Fort Dix plot, in which six men are accused of planning to attack soldiers at the base.</p>

        <p>A court clerk in southern New Jersey was dragged into the outer orbit of the Fort Dix terror case this week after she was charged with altering traffic tickets issued to one of the six suspects who have been indicted, the authorities announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the acting Camden County prosecutor, Joshua M. Ottenberg, said the charges against the clerk, Debra H. Benecke, 48, had nothing to do with the Fort Dix plot, in which six men are accused of planning to attack soldiers at the base.</p>
        <p>One of the six, Dritan Duka, 28, of Cherry Hill, N.J., was friendly with Ms. Benecke, who worked as a clerk in the town's municipal court, the authorities said. Seven months before federal agents arrested Mr. Duka, the authorities said, Ms. Benecke altered two traffic tickets for him, one for an illegal U-turn and one for driving without a license. Both were issued on Oct. 16, 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duka was due to appear in court to answer the tickets in Nov. 9, 2006. Ms. Benecke never entered the tickets into a computer system, the authorities said, but marked them as if they had been entered.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors did not say how the two knew each other, but said it was possible that Ms. Benecke's children were friendly with Mr. Duka. It appeared Ms. Benecke was simply doing Mr. Duka a favor, the authorities said, adding that no evidence had emerged that any money had been exchanged.</p>
        <p>Ms. Benecke was charged with official misconduct and tampering with records, and could be sentenced to up to 11 1/2 years in prison if found guilty of both charges, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>The charges against her started with a tip from federal investigators working on the Fort Dix case, the prosecutor's spokesman said.</p>
