        <p>Few names are as evocative of American history as that of Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys. But today Ethan Allen, the furniture and home furnishings company based in Danbury, Conn., is thoroughly international. Its chief executive is Farooq Kathwari, 62, who was born in Kashmir. Its manufacturing base is increasingly international as are its design motifs. Mr. Kathwari recently discussed the international influence. Following are excerpts:</p>
        <p>Q. Where is furniture made?</p>
        <p>A. Some 10 years ago, 85 percent of the furniture sold in the United States was made here. But today about 50 percent of the furniture sold here is made in the United States and 50 percent overseas, with China emerging as an important resource in the past 10 years.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the division of labor between America and China?</p>
        <p>A. More customized furniture is made in the United States. For instance, upholstered furniture such as sofas and chairs, which is made custom in a selected fabric, is made in the United States. On the other hand, we have a lot of wood resources in the United States, but 70 percent of our wood furniture is now made overseas even though countries such as China and the Philippines have to import the wood. Because of their labor, and also the technology they have added, this furniture is made overseas.</p>
        <p>Q. Can any American manufacturing of furniture be defended?</p>
        <p>A. In the case of Ethan Allen, we still have plants in Vermont, Maine and North Carolina making wood furniture. We are able to make furniture in solid woods. But unless it is very specialized, the chances are that over a period of time most furniture will leave the United States.</p>
        <p>Q. Is all going to China?</p>
        <p>A. China is getting a major portion, but countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are getting a fair share. I'd say China accounts for 50 and 60 percent of all the products imported into the United States.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you make sure that these products are made in conditions that Americans would find socially and environmentally acceptable?</p>
        <p>A. It's a hard question. There is a contradiction. On the one hand, we are talking about having products made overseas at lower prices, which often means lower wages, less control on environmental issues and not as good working or health conditions. All of those are challenges. I think it's important for the international community, especially the major leaders of the world and major businesses, to look into this and establish some standards. We cannot assume we are going to get all the benefits and do not really care about their working conditions. I think we have to help them raise their standards.</p>
        <p>Q. Are Americans now more open to more international design motifs?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, the diversity of designs coming into America is reflecting the diversity of people here. Until the past 20 years, we at Ethan Allen represented a style that was colonial and early American. Today we represent the diversity of styles from European countries to a mixture of ideas coming from China, Japan, India, Iran and other places.</p>
        <p>Q. How many different furniture tastes exist?</p>
        <p>A. The middle and upper middle parts of the population have become more stylish than ever. We've broken their tastes into seven lifestyles --Metro is more urban, youngish and modern. We have Villa, which represents the Mediterranean influences of Italy and France. We have a lifestyle called Loft, representing the casual urban lifestyle. Global represents the lifestyles that are more on the contemporary side but also very classic. Modern Glamour is more modern and glamorous obviously. We have one called Estate, which represents the lifestyle of the rich and the famous. Lastly, we have Country House, representing the attitude of the country.</p>
        <p>Q. Has embracing all these trends helped your business?</p>
        <p>A. Last year was somewhat difficult but we did about $1.4 billion in sales at retail. Our sales were up 12 percent. This year, we will be a little bit down. But over all our profitability has held up. We have continued to make great progress in repositioning and relocating our stores. I'm going to China next week to open a flagship design center in the south. It will be our 23rd there.</p>
        <p>Q. Do the Chinese like the same furniture Americans like?</p>
        <p>A. Absolutely. In fact, 50 percent of the product we sell in China is shipped from the United States.</p>
