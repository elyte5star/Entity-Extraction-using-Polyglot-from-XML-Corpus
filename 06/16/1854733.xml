        <p>''About to Be'' would have made a good title for the New York Philharmonic concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday. Rossini's Overture to ''Semiramide'' finds an Italian local-boy-made-good at the beginning of his wider European career. Schubert's Third Symphony places a Viennese teenager somewhere between his already prolific boyhood and a short but even more prolific adult life. Dvorak's Fifth Symphony marks the onset of the Czech composer's career-making publishing deal with the Simrock company and the support of Brahms that made it possible.</p>
        <p>Riccardo Muti was the other about-to-be here, although those with dreams of the eminent conductor as the Philharmonic's future music director will probably have to amend the description to won't-be, if not never-will-be.</p>

        <p>''About to Be'' would have made a good title for the New York Philharmonic concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday. Rossini's Overture to ''Semiramide'' finds an Italian local-boy-made-good at the beginning of his wider European career. Schubert's Third Symphony places a Viennese teenager somewhere between his already prolific boyhood and a short but even more prolific adult life. Dvorak's Fifth Symphony marks the onset of the Czech composer's career-making publishing deal with the Simrock company and the support of Brahms that made it possible.</p>
        <p>Riccardo Muti was the other about-to-be here, although those with dreams of the eminent conductor as the Philharmonic's future music director will probably have to amend the description to won't-be, if not never-will-be.</p>
        <p>Rarely will a program so match the personality of its conductor: three pieces, no doubt chosen by Mr. Muti, that radiated with unambiguous health. If other master conductors specialize in philosophical shades of gray, he is the musical equivalent of broad daylight. It takes tremendous skill to create performances so completely without artifice, so filled with energy and so naked in their intentions.</p>
        <p>The Rossini overture exploited the extraordinary fineness of which the Philharmonic is capable: paired horns sounding luxurious and beautifully tuned, strings playing with transparent delicacy and life.</p>
        <p>The Schubert is a curious piece for a composer who found his soul so early in life. One feels gripped, almost strangled, by sonata-form convention. Listeners catch only glimpses of the Schubert-to-be through clouds of near-boilerplate rhetoric, most clearly in the Allegretto's melodic twists and turns. Mr. Muti, on the other hand, believes in the boyish vitality of the finale and was determined that others believe as well.</p>
        <p>Dvorak was more himself in his Fifth Symphony. True, he was 34 and Schubert only 18, but then Schubert lived faster than the rest of us. Dvorak's piece has the easy grace of self-confidence and is already synthesizing Czech popular traditions. Movements begin with the unprepossessing suddenness that makes, for example, the later Symphony in G so irresistible.</p>
        <p>The New York Philharmonic will repeat the program tonight at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; (212) 875-5656.</p>
