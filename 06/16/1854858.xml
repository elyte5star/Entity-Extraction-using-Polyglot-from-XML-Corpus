        <p>A senior adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin, Igor I. Shuvalov, added new intrigue to the question of who might succeed Mr. Putin when he steps down next year. Mr. Shuvalov, in remarks widely reported in Russia, told a conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington on Thursday that Mr. Putin might yet turn to someone other than one of the two aides routinely touted as his most likely successor: Sergei B. Ivanov and Dmitri A. Medvedev. ''People talk about two candidates, possible candidates,'' he said, according to the center, ''but, you know, my president could trade another surprise, and maybe even late during this year you will know about another possible figure.'' His remarks revived speculation in Russia about other political figures close to Mr. Putin who might yet emerge. Mr. Shuvalov emphasized that Mr. Putin intended to step down, saying he did not want Russia to follow other post-Soviet states, like Belarus and Turkmenistan, whose leaders changed their constitutions to retain authoritarian power.</p>
