        <p>There was a time when movies like ''DOA: Dead or Alive'' lurked sheepishly at schoolboy height on video store shelves, spines straining to accommodate the charms of their actresses. But the multiplex is a beast that needs constant feeding, and sometimes the meal has to be cheese.</p>
        <p>For this latest fight-till-you-drop video game adaptation, the prolific Hong Kong filmmaker Corey Yuen traps us on an exotic island where a variety of lunkheads are competing for $10 million. The prime contestants are a ninja princess (Devon Aoki), a pro wrestler (Jaime Pressly) and an assassin-thief (Holly Valance), who all possess a similar martial artistry and allergy to clothing.</p>

        <p>There was a time when movies like ''DOA: Dead or Alive'' lurked sheepishly at schoolboy height on video store shelves, spines straining to accommodate the charms of their actresses. But the multiplex is a beast that needs constant feeding, and sometimes the meal has to be cheese.</p>
        <p>For this latest fight-till-you-drop video game adaptation, the prolific Hong Kong filmmaker Corey Yuen traps us on an exotic island where a variety of lunkheads are competing for $10 million. The prime contestants are a ninja princess (Devon Aoki), a pro wrestler (Jaime Pressly) and an assassin-thief (Holly Valance), who all possess a similar martial artistry and allergy to clothing.</p>
        <p>Celebrating both, Mr. Yuen parks his camera at gluteal height, ensuring that the ladies are captured at all times for maximum exposure and minimum obfuscation.</p>
        <p>Free of blood, bruises and visible trauma, ''DOA'' revels in its fakery. And though the film presents more exuberant female flesh than hiring day at Hooters, it's strictly for titillation. (A typical scene is a volleyball game so innocently buoyant that it might have been choreographed by Benny Hill.)</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the success of Paul Verhoeven, Mr. Yuen has yet to learn that all that jiggles is not cinematic gold.</p>
        <p>''DOA: Dead or Alive'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is nose cracking, leg spreading and as much gratuitous bouncing as the rating will permit.</p>
        <p>Dead or Alive  Opened yesterday nationwide.</p>
        <p>Directed by Cory Yuen; written by J. F. Lawton, based on the Tecmo video game series; directors of photography, Keung Kwok-Man and Chan Chi Ying; edited by Angie Lam; production designer, James Choo; produced by Jeremy Bolt, Paul W. S. Anderson and Robert Kulzer; released by Dimension Films. Running time: 99 minutes.</p>
        <p>WITH: Jaime Pressly (Tina), Holly Valance (Christie), Sarah Carter (Helena), Devon Aoki (Kasumi), Kane Kosugi (Hayabusa), Natassia Malthe (Ayane), Matthew Marsden (Max) and Eric Roberts (Donovan).</p>
