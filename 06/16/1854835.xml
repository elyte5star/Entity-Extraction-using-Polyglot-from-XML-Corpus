        <p>Borrowing costs are on the march higher as a big sell-off in the bond market this week sent yields on Treasury notes and bonds to a five-year high.</p>
        <p>Homeowners and home buyers shopping for a mortgage are likely to feel the pain of the rising rates first and most intensely. The national average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 6.74 percent, up from 6.53 percent in early June.</p>

        <p>Borrowing costs are on the march higher as a big sell-off in the bond market this week sent yields on Treasury notes and bonds to a five-year high.</p>
        <p>Homeowners and home buyers shopping for a mortgage are likely to feel the pain of the rising rates first and most intensely. The national average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 6.74 percent, up from 6.53 percent in early June.</p>
        <p>Higher rates appear to be less of a threat to businesses, at least for now.</p>
        <p>But economists and market specialists caution that another big move up could jeopardize corporate buyouts that are financed by sales of junk bonds.</p>
        <p>A report Thursday from the Mortgage Bankers Association, meanwhile, provided a mixed picture, indicating that more homeowners with subprime credit are likely to have trouble making house payments. The problems have not spread far into the larger pool of prime borrowers, the report suggested.</p>
        <p>Perhaps reflecting that more sanguine view, stocks climbed late in the week and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both appeared poised to eclipse their recent highs. For the week, the S.&amp; P. gained 1.7 percent and the Dow 1.6 percent.</p>
        <p>Stronger retail sales and more moderate inflation for everything except food and energy provided a boost to the stock market. In spite of an anemic first quarter, forecasters are now saying the economy could pick up speed in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>It is also possible that some of the money investors took out of Treasuries is moving into stocks.</p>
        <p>As has been the case for some months now, the direction of the economy is likely to hinge on the relative strength and weakness of the housing market and corporate profits.</p>
