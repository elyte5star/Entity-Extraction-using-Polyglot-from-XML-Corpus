        <p>WHEN a teenage immigrant from Dublin named Tommy Rowles started tending bar in New York in 1958, he quickly had to learn how to make a rusty nail, pink lady and brandy Alexander.

        <p>WHEN a teenage immigrant from Dublin named Tommy Rowles started tending bar in New York in 1958, he quickly had to learn how to make a rusty nail, pink lady and brandy Alexander. This was at Bemelmans Bar, the landmark lounge in the Carlyle, where Mr. Rowles, 67, has worked ever since.</p>
        <p>The decades brought more concoctions to learn: the Harvey Wallbanger, seabreeze, cosmopolitan and the cocktails that two of the city's boldface-name mixologists, Dale DeGroff and Audrey Saunders, introduced during their spells managing the Bemelmans. More recently, Mr. Rowles had to learn to make yet another newfangled cocktail: the Tommy Rowles.</p>
        <p>''I'm just a bartender, not a chef,'' Mr. Rowles said. ''When I started, they had a book behind the bar, with something like 400 or 500 drinks, and that was it.'' Now Mr. Rowles is in the book.The drink, conceived as a tribute to his storied 48-year tenure, was created by Brian Van Flandern, who ended a three-year stint of mixing drinks at Per Se in February to revamp the cocktail program at Bemelmans.</p>
        <p>The bar is steeped in tradition. With its crimson-jacketed staff, Art Deco flourishes and dreamy piano music, Bemelmans evokes a black-and-white vision of bygone Manhattan in which all the men wore fedoras, all the women wore pearls, and they all blithely smoked their heads off.</p>
        <p>But none of its traditions may be more vibrant than Mr. Rowles, who captains the day shift. He is famed for his bloody mary mix -- a secret recipe of his own devising -- and for an across-the-bar exchange with Harry S. Truman during which Mr. Rowles confessed his distaste for bourbon, Mr. Truman's liquor of choice.</p>
        <p>''If you had to walk 15 blocks with those guys following you,'' the former president said of the reporters who accompanied his daily constitutional, ''you'd drink this, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowles -- slender and white-haired and with a bona fide twinkle in his eyes, hoary stereotype notwithstanding -- isn't one to crow about his tribute. Modesty precludes it.</p>
        <p>''For me, having come from Ireland, it feels good,'' is the extent of his preening. ''I know my mother would be proud.''</p>
        <p>When the uninitiated order a Tommy Rowles from Mr. Rowles, he doesn't let on, even if they start carping. ''Some people, you know, they'll say it's too sweet or not sweet enough,'' he said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>Sweetly astringent is what it is. ''It's basically a Cognac and tonic, when you get down to it,'' explained Mr. Van Flandern, who rounds off that combination -- a classic in Europe, more unfamiliar here -- with simple syrup, lime juice and a whisper of rum. ''But what a great summertime drink,'' he said. ''Imagine walking off the hot sidewalk and right into that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowles, though, would imagine something else.</p>
        <p>''A Heineken,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Touched by the tribute, however, he couldn't help confess, ''All these new drinks drive me nuts.''</p>
        <p>TOMMY ROWLES  Adapted From Bemelmans Bar</p>

        <p>Mix all ingredients except club soda and lime wedge in a cocktail shaker without ice and shake vigorously. Pour into a highball glass filled with ice. Add club soda and gently roll the mixture back and forth between shaker and glass. Garnish with lime wedge and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield -- 1 serving</p>
