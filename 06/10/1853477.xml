        <p>Whimsical and melancholic, playful and heavy as a heart swollen with emotion, Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film ''PIERROT LE FOU'' opens with Jean-Paul Belmondo sitting in a bathtub, a cigarette stuck in his mouth, a book clutched in his hands. He's reading about the Spanish painter Velázquez, but what he's really doing is, much as the Good Witch of the North does in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' showing us the road we're to follow: ''Past the age of 50,'' Mr. Belmondo reads, ''Velázquez stopped painting definite things. He hovered around objects with the air, with twilight, catching in his shadows and airy backgrounds the palpitations of color, which formed the invisible code of his silent symphony.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Godard was only 34 when he made ''Pierrot le Fou,'' but he was already looking back at the past (including his 1959 feature debut ''Breathless,'' with its movie shots heard round the world), and gazing ahead. Nominally based on the Lionel White novel ''Obsession,'' the film finds Mr. Belmondo as a married man on the lam with the dangerously lovely Anna Karina (then Mrs. Godard) in a self-conscious pantomime of l'amour fou. In between definite things, like stolen cars and bursts of red, there are glorious, witty bits of dialogue, snatches of music, furtive and loving moments (with Picasso, Renoir and van Gogh), splashes of Piet Mondrian yellow, blue and red, invocations of cinema (''Pépe le Moko''), in other words, as Mr. Belmondo explains at one point, a film with ''space  feeling.''</p>
        <p>''Pierrot le Fou'' will be presented in a new 35-millimeter print, and there is word that a new Criterion edition is in the works. ''Breathless'' is also being shown for an extra Belmondo-Godard treat. ''Breathless,'' Wednesday and Thursday; ''Pierrot le Fou,'' Friday through June 26; Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org.</p>
