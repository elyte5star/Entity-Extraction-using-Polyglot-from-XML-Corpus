        <p>CALLING all astronauts! To Waterbury?</p>
        <p>That's where Paul Largay, the president of Largay Travel, which specializes in adventure vacations, is selling seats on Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, scheduled to begin suborbital flights from the Mojave Desert to the fringe of space in late 2009.</p>
        <p>Mr. Largay, 49, is one of 65 agents worldwide and the only one in the state authorized by London-based Virgin Galactic, a division of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Airways, to sell seats on the spacecraft. Mr. Largay was selected from an initial group of about 250 luxury travel agents after a long application process and a series of interviews with the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Largay, who lives in Woodbury, said he normally sells vacations like hot air balloon trips above the Alps and safaris to Africa for $20,000 to $300,000 to customers as far away as Europe, South America and the Cayman Islands. He said he underwent two days of training at Cape Canaveral in Florida before he began selling the space flights.</p>
        <p>''It was mostly about how to address people's concerns and about the technology that is being used,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Carolyn Wincer, the head of astronaut sales for Virgin Galactic, said Mr. Largay was chosen because of his experience, track record and client base.</p>
        <p>''What we also really wanted were agents that were passionate about getting commercial space travel off the ground and making it a viable industry, and wanted to get in on the ground floor,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wincer said that since February, almost 200 people from 20 countries had agreed to pay $200,000 to be guaranteed a seat on one of the first flights on SpaceShipTwo, which will take six people at a time 70 miles above the Earth to the edge of space and back in roughly two hours.</p>
        <p>She said that during the flight, passengers would be able to leave their seats and experience weightlessness, and their view will span 800 miles in any direction and include the curvature of the Earth and the blackness of space.</p>
        <p>''It will be a real space flight,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Largay said he had four potential customers for the flight (a husband and wife and two men), none of whom wished to be identified. He said one was from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Besides wealth, Mr. Largay said the four share one trait. ''They each just have a real sense of adventure,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mark Patterson, 55, a financier from Bronxville who bought his seat directly through Virgin Galactic, said that being one of the first civilians to fly into space was what attracted him.</p>
        <p>''To be in the first 10,000 people is not nearly as exciting as being in the first 100 or so,'' he said. ''It's a tiny little community that is going to get to say they did this.''</p>
        <p>That exclusivity, Mr. Largay said, is what makes the trip so attractive to those with the desire and the money.</p>
        <p>''I've said to some of my clients that are interested: 'I can warranty you this: that you will never go to a cocktail party after you've taken this flight and have someone say ''checkmate'' to you.' ''</p>
