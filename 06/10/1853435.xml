        <p>Grace Kelly, the movie star who became a real-life princess when she married Prince Rainier in 1956, right, and the tragic victim of a car crash in 1982, revisits the French Riviera this summer when the Grimaldi Forum Monaco (www.grimaldiforum.com) pays tribute to her in an exhibition from July 12 through Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>The exhibit, ''The Grace Kelly Years, Princess of Monaco,'' uses 15 walk-through rooms to reflect different eras of her life, including ''New York,'' which covers her early theatrical career; ''Hitchcock,'' which explores her work with the celebrated director and was designed to replicate the set from the 1954 movie ''Rear Window''; ''Wedding,'' where her wedding dress -- a gift from the MGM designer Helen Rose -- is on display; and ''Official,'' which contains the princess's belt and diadem.</p>
