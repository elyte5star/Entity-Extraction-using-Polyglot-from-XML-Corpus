        <p>GEMSON--Donald H., M.D., One of the nation's foremost experts in preventive medicine and a tireless public health advocate whose efforts helped ensure passage of New York's smoking ban, died on Thursday, May 31, 2007, after a brief illness. He was 55 years old. At the time of his death, Dr. Gemson continued to be a leader in the medical and public health communities. He was medical director for Merrill Lynch, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society of New York and New Jersey, and an associate clinical professor of public health at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. As a champion of tobacco control, at the height of public debate on the city's clean indoor air law in 2003, Dr. Gemson served as chair of the NYC Coalition for a Smokefree New York. He provided key expert testimony at numerous public hearings and was an omnipresent speaker at local forums in support of the law. His many honors included being named one of New York's top preventive medicine physicians for the fourth consecutive year by Castle Connolly Medical Ltd. A 20-year volunteer for the American Cancer Society, in addition to being elected chief medical officer, he chaired the Society's local Professional Education Committee. Dr. Gemson also served as a consultant in the development of the ''Working Well'' worksite health assessment tool, helped design and implement the Society's cancer prevention, education and patient support programs and chaired the organization's Tobacco Strike Force. Donald H. Gemson has authored or co-authored over 30 publications in peerreviewed medical journals. He is survived by his wife Lesley Field, his son Edward and daughter Maya.
