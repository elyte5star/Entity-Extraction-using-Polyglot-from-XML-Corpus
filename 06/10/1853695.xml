        <p>The American spirit of inventiveness didn't die with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, it is stronger than ever, if you look at the number of applications flooding into the United States Patent Office.</p>
        <p>Now the office is looking at a backlog of 700,000 applications, and an average review time of 31 months, and it is saying to the inventors of America: ''Could you tone it down a little?'' Last week, the agency proposed new rules that would require more information from inventors and allow greater public review of applications.</p>
        <p>The office is also approving a smaller share of applications: around 50 percent so far this year, down from 72 percent in 2000.</p>
        <p>To improve the odds of your invention being approved for a patent, make sure that it is both new and useful, and that a description of it is understandable in writing.</p>
        <p>And please don't waste the patent office's time with an idea that is obvious. If you do, it is sure to be rejected (perhaps with a big roll of the eyes) because it didn't pass the ''duh'' test.</p>
