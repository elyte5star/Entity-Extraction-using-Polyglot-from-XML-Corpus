        <p>Diane G. Farrell, a Democrat from Westport who lost two close races to Representative Christopher Shays, has been nominated by President Bush to serve on the board of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell, whose aggressive campaigns captured national attention, said she had spent the last few months being vetted for the director's post at the bank.

        <p>Diane G. Farrell, a Democrat from Westport who lost two close races to Representative Christopher Shays, has been nominated by President Bush to serve on the board of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell, whose aggressive campaigns captured national attention, said she had spent the last few months being vetted for the director's post at the bank. If confirmed by Congress, Ms. Farrell will serve out the term vacated by Max Cleland, the former Democratic senator from Georgia. The term expires on Jan. 20, 2011.</p>
        <p>The 70-year-old Washington bank helps finance the export of domestic goods and services to global markets. Its board is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell, a former first selectwoman in Westport who also served on the town's Board of Finance, said her background in finance and marketing would help her in her new position, which pays $145,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''It's a real convergence of my professional and business career,'' Ms. Farrell said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell said that Senator Christopher J. Dodd approached her in January about the position at the bank. Senator Dodd is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which will vote on her nomination. Ms. Farrell has called Senator Dodd a mentor and is supporting him in his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Senator Dodd said Ms. Farrell would be ''a tireless fighter for America's exporters.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell said she had ruled out another run for Congress in 2008 against Representative Shays, a Republican in his 10th term.</p>
        <p>''I believe you are a much more attractive candidate when you are not a perennial candidate,'' Ms. Farrell said. ''For me, it's always been about service, and I'm eager to get back to work.''</p>
