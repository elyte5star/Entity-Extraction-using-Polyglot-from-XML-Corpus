        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Corby Kummer's review of Barbara Kingsolver's ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' (May 20) missed the point that the book not only offers ways American families can make food decisions in their daily lives, but also helps them think about how those decisions affect the rest of the world. Industrial farming and food aid can have disastrous effects on developing countries. While food aid and imported food purport to address the problem of hunger, they often exacerbate it by crippling local agriculture's ability to compete and be profitable. Sustainable agriculture, on the other hand, provides a long-term solution that addresses both hunger and its root cause, poverty.</p>
