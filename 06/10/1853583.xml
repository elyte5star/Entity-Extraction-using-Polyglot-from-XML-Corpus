        <p>LAST month, the travels of a man infected with lethal tuberculosis placed hundreds of fellow airplane passengers at risk. More recently, four men were accused in a plot to attack Kennedy International Airport that could have left thousands dead. Yet despite such reminders, public concern about terrorism that could result in mass casualties has been shrinking.</p>
        <p>Recent polls found that only about 20 percent of Americans consider terrorism a major concern, down from 76 percent in 2003. This diminished sense of urgency troubles security officials in New Jersey, who believe the threat to the state remains unabated. Mirroring the downturn in public concern, financing for emergency preparedness, especially at hospitals, has been shrinking.</p>
        <p>In the wake of 9/11, money from the United States Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services streamed into New Jersey and other states for emergency preparedness. Hospitals were major beneficiaries, though by 2006 federal support had declined sharply. Some New Jersey hospitals that had received $150,000 or more in 2005 for protective equipment, drills and educational programs have seen this year's financing fall to as little as $20,000. As a result, the state's emergency readiness could be in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>For example, most of New Jersey's 82 hospitals conduct one or two drills a year for terrorism and disaster events. But the quality of these exercises varies. Some conduct full-scale drills with dozens of participants whose performance is carefully evaluated. But, according to David Gruber, New Jersey's assistant health commissioner, drills at other hospitals may now involve only ''three people sitting in a room, sharing information with each other, with no follow-up.'' The problem is compounded as hospital chiefs scramble to find scarce dollars for daily upkeep.</p>
        <p>A solution would be to mandate standards for emergency preparedness much as we do for fire protection. By law, New Jersey hospitals must conduct at least four fire drills a year that include personnel from every shift. The costs of these exercises, including the maintenance of smoke alarms, extinguishers and other equipment can be as high as $50,000 a year per hospital. No one questions the need or expense for this kind of protection even though almost none of New Jersey's hospitals have ever had a major fire.</p>
        <p>Yet many of these institutions were involved in treating evacuees from Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11. For example, Jersey City Medical Center treated 175 victims who were ferried across the Hudson River, and the University Hospital in Newark saw about 50. A month later, anthrax spores were found to have leaked from letters that were processed at a postal distribution center in Hamilton, near Trenton. Three infected victims were treated at nearby Robert Wood Johnson Hospital, which had to test more than 1,300 others who had been exposed to the deadly bacteria. An additional 400 suspected anthrax victims were seen at St. Francis Hospital in Trenton.</p>
        <p>A statewide mock biological attack in 2005 demonstrated huge differences among hospitals in their ability to cope with a large-scale emergency. The exercise underscored the need for mandated standards that would include three imperatives.</p>
        <p>First, every hospital should be able to increase normal capacity by at least 20 percent in case of a sudden influx of victims. Second, all of New Jersey's hospitals should have a full-time staffer devoted to emergency preparedness. Third, rehearsals for biological, chemical and other disaster events should be conducted according to uniform procedures.</p>
        <p>We should not wait for another terrorist attack to provide impetus toward that goal.</p>
