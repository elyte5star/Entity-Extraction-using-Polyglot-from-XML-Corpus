        <p>Editorial, noting miseries that riders must endure, supports Metropolitan Transportation Authority board's recommendation to continue to allow sale or use of alcohol on Metro-North and Long Island Rail road trains</p>

        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- worried, in part, about sloppy drunks bothering other passengers and being menaces on the drive home from the train station -- recently entertained the idea of prohibiting the sale or use of alcohol on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road trains.</p>
        <p>But the forces of commuter conviviality are apparently far stronger than any agency's nanny impulse. William Neuman reported in The Times recently that a committee of the authority's board had recommended keeping the alcohol status quo, given the ''overwhelmingly negative response'' it received from riders about the proposed ban.</p>
        <p>It is likely that the full board will follow the committee's recommendations, and that life aboard the 7:22 to Huntington or the 6:42 to New Haven will roll along, as merry as always.</p>
        <p>Merriness is only part of it. It was striking to read, in Mr. Neuman's account, how critical the bar car is to modulating the mood of the segment of the riding population that uses it. ''It's one of the things that makes this slog north or east palatable,'' said one rider, Richard Shea, a public relations executive who helped start an advocacy group to preserve his right to a Bud Light on the 6:52 to Chappaqua.</p>
        <p>He and fellow members of the group, Commuters Allied for Responsible Enjoyment, argued that it was unfair to take away their sociable beers just to prevent the falling-down drunks who stumble into cars after concerts and sports events and the hard-core drinkers who usually get their buzz before they get the train. They have a point. One side effect of stressful workdays made more so by long, arduous commuting trips is that people feel the need to use the train time -- an hour or more -- for rapid, chemically accelerated decompression.</p>
        <p>This page has been skeptical of the authority's eagerness to profit from that demand, using its employees as rolling booze merchants while neglecting the litter and loudness that on-board drinking brings.</p>
        <p>But as long as people's rides are punctuated by miseries -- late trains, cold trains, hot trains, dirty trains, squawking announcements or no announcements -- it seemed heartless of the authority to go completely dry, depriving all riders the pleasure of a homebound beer. That argument apparently was clinched by the lack of evidence that train-borne alcohol fuels a detectable pattern of drunken driving or other mayhem.</p>
        <p>In a better world, commuting would not be so miserable that riders would feel the need to make a beeline for the bartender or schlep aboard with multiple cans of Foster's Lager in doubled-up plastic bags just to make it home. But this is the world we live in, so it seems hardly right to stamp out the rituals that make it bearable -- as when tightly wound men and women loosen up in the packed but friendly confines of a rush-hour bar car, playing cards, socializing and rolling along into the night.</p>
