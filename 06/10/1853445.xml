        <p>Race weekend at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., just outside Charlotte, is 2,000 acres of pure American spectacle. Thousands of Nascar fans, some in $49 tents bought at Wal-Mart and others in expensive RVs whose amenities rival that of luxury hotels, camp in the heart of the oval track, often arriving early in the day, and set up their temporary homes as they await the night's main event.</p>
        <p>On the weekend of May 19, the photographer Chris Ramirez joined the crowd watching the Nascar Nextel All-Star Challenge race (won by Kevin Harvick in a close finish over last year's champion, Jimmie Johnson) and captured this uniquely American ritual in all its glory.</p>

        <p>Few of life's creature comforts were left behind at home, as fans stoked the fires in their elaborate portable barbecue pits or gathered in front of plasma televisions atop mobile homes, allowing them not only to see the race live but to experience it in high def as well.</p>
