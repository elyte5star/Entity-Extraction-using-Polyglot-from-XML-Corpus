        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Why is it so often assumed that the cost of child care is subtracted from the salary of the working mother, rather than that of the working father or, in a two-income household, from both salaries?</p>
        <p>If we thought in terms of working fathers contributing to the cost of child care, we might also think in terms of nannies as a ''fraught'' aspect of modern fatherhood, and about overworked dads who can't live without their nannies.</p>
        <p>Maybe this all occurs to me because my father raised my sister and me with, for some years, the help of a woman to whom he paid a salary. Might there be a time when child care workers are not automatically assumed to be women?</p>
