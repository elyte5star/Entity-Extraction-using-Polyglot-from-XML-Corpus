        <p>HOEXTER--Dr. Barton, of Great Neck and Manhattan, died peacefully on June 3, 2007 at the age of 70. Recognized as one of the country's pre-eminent colon-rectal surgeons, Bart studied at Horace Mann, Kenyon College and George Washington University School of Medicine. He was a member of the Phi Delta Epsilon Fraternity, St. George Society, Smith-ReedRussell Medical Honor Society, and the Alpha Omega Alpha Society. He served as a Navy physician, Chief Resident at Mt. Sinai Hospital, President of the LI Gastroenterological Association, President of the NY Society of Colon &amp; Rectal Surgeons, President of Medical Staff at NSUH, founder and President of the Colon &amp; Rectal Surgical Association of LI, and an Associate Clinical Professor at Cornell.

He was the beloved husband of Nadya (Snaider) Hoexter; father of Jill, Laura, and Ken; stepfather of Leland; grandfather of Zachary, Benjamin, and Samantha; and brother of Joan and David. Bart was a true caregiver, altruist, teacher, friend and pillar of strength to all who knew him. His kind and generous spirit will be deeply missed by all who benefited from his humor, wisdom, and integrity. Funeral services will be at Temple Emmanuel in Great Neck on June 5th at 11am.</p>
