        <p>The field of classical music only intermittently engages itself with nonmusical issues, and when it does, it is often in the form of a benefit. But this week ANTHONY DE MARE, a pianist, is presenting a recital as a companion to ''The Missing Peace: Artists Consider the Dalai Lama'' at the Rubin Museum, with spirituality as the common theme. The program ranges from works by Bach to ''Missing Peace'' by James Mobberly, an electro-acoustic piece that includes Tibetan chants and was written for the occasion. Other works include Meredith Monk's ''urban march -- shadow,'' Scelsi's Suite No. 9 (''Ttai''), and Debussy's ''Terrasse des Audiences du Clair de Lune.'' Wednesday at 7 p.m., 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $25.</p>
        <p>Wednesday is also the start of the MANNES INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL FOR CONTEMPORARY PERFORMANCE, which brings in new-music specialists for master classes, symposiums and concerts. The first two concerts include premieres by Keith Fitch and César Camarero, as well as pieces by composers young, old, and late, like Vladimir Tarnopolski and Iannis Xenakis. The performers include Susan Narucki, a soprano known for her contemporary work; Rolf Schulte, a violinist; and the Plural Ensemble, a Spanish new-music group led by Fabián Panisello. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Mannes College The New School for Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, newschool.edu/mannes; $20.</p>
        <p>Despite all of this new music, a focus remains on the old. RICCARDO MUTI, one of the few conductors consistently able to get sparks out of the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, continues his two-week visit, conducting Schubert's Third and Dvorak's Fifth symphonies: hardly trailblazing, though less often performed. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96.</p>
