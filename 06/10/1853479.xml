        <p>FESTIVATE vi.: to pass the summer in the attendance of arts festivals, especially those of a theatrical nature (see also culture vulture).</p>
        <p>This useful verb, which has yet to make Webster's, is particularly applicable in New York between Memorial and Labor Days, when it is possible to spend every evening (and many an afternoon) at some celebratory theatrical performance or another, be it earnest (the Lincoln Center Festival) or impudent (the Pretentious Festival).</p>
        <p>Now joining, and seriously swelling, the roster of citywide theme productions is New York's first National Asian American Theater Festival, beginning with a gala on Monday and performances Tuesday through June 24. It promises to cover the boroughs as assiduously and enthusiastically as the New York-intoxicated sailors in ''On the Town'' did. Staged in locations as far-flung as La MaMa E.T.C. in the East Village and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island, the festival features more than 25 troupes and solo artists of Asian heritage based throughout the United States (with the expected emphasis on the left and right coasts).</p>
        <p>Some of the companies are well-known to venturesome New York theatergoers, including the National Asian American Theater Company (which is presenting its popular reinterpretation of García Lorca's ''House of Bernarda Alba''), Ma-Yi (which is restaging the Obie-winning ''Romance of Magno Rubio,'' about a Filipino migrant worker in the 1930s) and Ping Chong &amp; Company. But expect more exotic -- yet oddly familar-sounding -- offerings from performance artists and comedy troupes. Among the titles: ''Wong Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' ''U-Hauls, Bridesmaids and Backwards Mountain,'' ''Guns and Tampons: A History of Violence Against Women I Know'' and ''The Caste &amp; the Furious: Tokyo Drift.'' For those whose appetites range beyond the aesthetic, there is ''Cooking Con Karimi (Con Castro),'' during which, it is promised, ''the audience gets to eat free food prepared by live chefs.''
