        <p>WHEN temperatures are mild and it is not raining, a collection of rugged Puerto Rican men fills the benches near the East 149th Street entrance to St. Mary's Park in Mott Haven. They are burly and often tattooed, and they wear matching black leather jackets.</p>
        <p>They are members of the Bronx Classics Bike Club. But that's bike as in Schwinn, not bike as in Harley. Just about wherever they go, in other words, they pedal.</p>
        <p>Club members do not have to be Puerto Rican -- only one out of the roster of 60 is not -- but when riding in official parades, they do have to wear the island's flag, stitched, along with Old Glory, into the $120 custom leather jackets. Most will ride today in the city's Puerto Rican Day parade.</p>
        <p>Also, all bikes must be classics or replicas of classics. The club president's bike was manufactured in 1995 but is modeled on a 1950 Schwinn.</p>
        <p>The uniform but motley middle-aged gang tools around the Bronx together most weekend days. Wherever they go, they draw looks, cheers and new members.</p>
        <p>Many club members work continually to upgrade their rides, traveling to flea markets in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in search of classic bicycles. Each bike is a work in progress.</p>
        <p>Some members have rigged bells, sirens or elaborate sound systems to their handlebars and bicycle frames. But club rules say everyone must pay attention to when and where he makes a ruckus.</p>
        <p>''I like my group to be respectful,'' said the club president, Carlos Ramos, also known as Tony. ''These are not little hoodlums.''</p>
        <p>They are grown men, riding bicycles, weather permitting.</p>
