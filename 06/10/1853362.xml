        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-24</p>
        <p>Gunmen Breach Israeli Barrier  At least four Palestinian gunmen using an armored vehicle and grenade launchers broke through Israel's border fence from Gaza and fought a gun battle with Israeli soldiers, while Israeli troops entered Gaza near the town of Rafah.  24</p>
        <p>Iraq Looms as Bush Meets Pope  President Bush met for the first time with Pope Benedict XVI, and while both men are religious conservatives who share many similar concerns, in their private talk the pope raised his worries about the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>12</p>
        <p>Bomber Kills 12 Iraqi Soldiers  A suicide bomber killed at least a dozen Iraqi soldiers and wounded 30 more when he drove a truck packed with explosives into an Iraqi Army checkpoint guarding a compound in Iskandariya, a restive village south of Baghdad that has long been an insurgent stronghold. 24</p>
        <p>Women Alter Corporate Korea  As an increasing number of women have joined South Korean companies as professionals in the past half decade, the country has struggled to change the thoroughly male-centered corporate culture, starting with alcohol.  1</p>
        <p>Trinidad Muslims Deny Plot Tie  Members of Jamaat al-Muslimeen, denying that their group was tied to a plot to bomb a New York City airport, portrayed themselves as both Islamists and islanders, devoted to God but also part of the multicultural mix that defines the Caribbean nations of Trinidad and Tobago.  3</p>
        <p>Chinese Detainees in Limbo  At least 15 of 17 Uighurs, Muslims from western China, who remain at Guantánamo Bay have been cleared for release, but without a place to go. American diplomats say the Uighurs have asked nearly 100 countries for refuge, only to find that Chinese officials have warned some of those same nations not to accept them. 1</p>
        <p>Legacies of War in Ivory Coast  A journey between Abidjan, the seat of the loyalist government in the Ivory Coast, and Bouaké, the rebel capital, reveals a nation eager for reconciliation but saddled with the legacies of war and division.  22</p>
        <p>NATIONAL 26-35</p>
        <p>Derailing of Immigration Bill  Many contributed to the undoing of the immigration bill in the Senate this week, but none more effectively than Republicans who joined a nationwide Internet and talk radio campaign against the measure.  1</p>
        <p>Democrats Court Hispanics  Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination are moving to court Hispanic voters. A string of early primary states with huge Hispanic voting blocs are prompting campaigns to hire outreach consultants, start Spanish-language Web sites and fill their schedules with appearances before Hispanic audiences.  1</p>
        <p>Private Loans Lure Students  As college tuition has soared past the limits on federal aid, unregulated private loans have become the fastest-growing sector of the student finance market. 28</p>
        <p>New Tack in Antitrust Policy  Nearly a decade after the government began its landmark antitrust effort to try to break up Microsoft, the Bush administration has sharply changed course by repeatedly defending the company. 1</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION 37-42</p>
        <p>A Loophole on Donations  According to a watchdog group that monitors campaign financing, limited liability corporations now account for $12 million in New York State political donations. The companies make donors' identities difficult to trace, and afford them loopholes to give more than individuals are permitted Under state rules. 37</p>
