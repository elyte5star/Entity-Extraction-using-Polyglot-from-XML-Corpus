        <p>REICH--Louis, June 9, 2007, age 104. Beloved husband of the late Kitty. Adored father of Honey and Norman Mann, Jay (deceased) and June. Dear brother of Anne.

Admired and highly respected by those in Wall St., who knew him as an honest, trustworthy man. He was a mentor and friend to those who needed support and help in good times as well as bad times.
