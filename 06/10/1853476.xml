        <p>More often than not there is flamenco in some form or another to be had on New York stages. More often than not it isn't very good. If you need to be reminded of what the real deal looks and sounds like, head to Theater 80, where the Spanish company NOCHE FLAMENCA has the premiere of ''Aldaba.'' The concerts feature the marvelous Soledad Barrio, one of the great performers of our time. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m., and Sundays at 2 and 5 p.m., through July 29, 80 St. Marks Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $55.</p>
        <p>If one jewel doesn't satisfy, a triptych awaits this week at the New York State Theater, where NEW YORK CITY BALLET will twice perform George Balanchine's masterly ''Jewels,'' set to music by Fauré, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. The casts promise a host of delights, including several debuts in ''Emeralds'': Ana Sophia Scheller and Tiler Peck on Tuesday, and Sara Mearns and Megan LeCrone on Thursday. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.org; $20 to $95.</p>
        <p>All of the performers in the newest DANCEMOPOLITAN series, Reunion, are seasoned. This month's event, ''Villains and Heroes, the 100 most influential people who (n)ever lived,'' will have as its host the choreographer Stephen Petronio and will feature eight of his former dancers: Gerald Casel, Ori Flomin, Kristina Isabelle, Ashleigh Leite, Jeremy Nelson, Jimena Paz, Todd Williams and Ellis Wood. If Mr. Petronio has had any influence, these choreographic portraits of the famous are sure to be highly physical, and tinged with dark humor and erotic overtones. Thursday and Friday at 9:30 p.m,. Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20.</p>
