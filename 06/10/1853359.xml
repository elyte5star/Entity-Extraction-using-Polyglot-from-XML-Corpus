        <p>Plenty of signs attest that the civil war that cleaved this country in two for half a decade is finally over.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of a peace agreement signed in March, the commander of the rebel army has become the prime minister, sharing power with his old nemesis, President Laurent Gbagbo. Militias loyal to the government have thrown weapons by the hundreds upon pyres in a symbolic disarmament. United Nations peacekeepers have dismantled their checkpoint in the buffer zone between Abidjan, a southern city that is the seat of the government, and this northern capital of the rebellion.</p>
        <p>But for Kone Djakandja, a trucker who hauls agricultural products, the lifeblood of what was once the wealthiest and fastest-growing economy in West Africa, nothing has really changed on his weekly route from Ferkessedougou, where he picks up truckloads of sugar, to Abidjan, where he delivers the loads.</p>
        <p>''Every week I make this trip, and every week it is the same,'' Mr. Djakandja said as he waited at a truck stop for other drivers to form a convoy. ''The rebels stop me and demand money. The government soldiers demand money. They say we are one country now, but it is not a reality yet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gbagbo signed an agreement with the rebel commander, Guillaume Soro, to end the five-year-old conflict and reunify a country that has been split since 2002.</p>
        <p>The agreement is the latest in a string of pacts, each of which has previously stumbled at the same fault lines that have thwarted resolution of this conflict -- how to disarm the militias on both sides and how to decide, in a country full of migrants and their descendants, who is entitled to Ivorian citizenship?</p>
        <p>The rebels have argued that people born here should be considered citizens even if their grandparents or parents migrated, while the government has resisted weakening strict citizenship laws and documentation requirements that previous generations also be Ivorian.</p>
        <p>''This is not a war of resources, it is not a war of tribalism, it is not like other African wars,'' said Cissé Sindou, a top official in the New Forces, the rebel army in the north. ''It is a war about the search for true democracy and identity. And this agreement should settle that question for once and all.''</p>
        <p>The March agreement has brought new hope, however, in large part because it represents the first time the two leaders, Mr. Gbagbo and Mr. Soro, have personally struck a deal. It lays out an ambitious timeline to disarm militias, issue an identification card to everyone entitled to one and hold elections. Militias and cards have been sticking points, and mistrust abounds. The United Nations-patrolled buffer zone dividing north and south has officially been dismantled, but neither side has removed its checkpoints.</p>
        <p>''Dismantling of the militias is a process, and the willingness to start is a good sign,'' Mr. Sindou said. ''But it is still a process, so we will be on guard.''</p>
        <p>A journey between Abidjan, the government seat, and Bouaké, the rebel capital, reveals a nation eager for reconciliation but caught between war and peace, its once-mighty economy hobbled, its cosmopolitan image sullied, its place as a symbol of stability and progress long gone.</p>
        <p>The rebellion sought to topple the government of Mr. Gbagbo, who was elected in a vote boycotted by the main opposition groups because their favored candidate, Alassane Outtara, had not been allowed to run. Mr. Outtara's opponents claimed he was originally from Burkina Faso, not Ivory Coast, barring him from running under a law requiring that both parents of a candidate be born in Ivory Coast. The law was inspired by xenophobia that gripped the nation as its fortunes waned in the late 1990s.</p>
        <p>For decades, Ivory Coast's booming agricultural economy had relied on immigrants from neighboring Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea to plant and reap its rich cocoa and coffee crops; the country's longtime president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, had made it his country's policy to defuse ethnic tensions for the sake of prosperity.</p>
        <p>But after Mr. Houphouët-Boigny died in 1993, Ivory Coast, with its once-humming economy slipping, slid into a rancorous debate about identity and who should enjoy the nation's diminishing returns. That debate ultimately became a civil war.</p>
        <p>The actual fighting was intense but brief, just a few months of open combat before a cease-fire was signed and a buffer zone, policed by French and United Nations peacekeepers, was established to enforce it. As a result, the country had relatively little destruction. Abidjan's coiled expressways still swoop effortlessly over its lagoons, even if impoverished squatters have taken up residence beneath them. The Hotel Ivoire, the once glamorous symbol of Abidjan's cosmopolitan past, still shoots up, far above the city, even if its artificial lake and ice-skating rink are empty these days and skeins of black mold snake up its walls.</p>
        <p>Still, a sense of decay, both physical and social, has set in as violence pervades political discourse.</p>
        <p>Pro-government groups like the Young Patriots and the Ivorian students union, known by its French acronym, Fesci, have taken on a new and menacing role in the country's political life, one that often includes violence and will be hard for the present and future governments to contain. University professors were on strike in May for more pay, a strike the violent and politically powerful students union opposed. The Ivorian League for Human Rights has supported the professors, so Fesci attacked the headquarters in Abidjan in May. Patrick N'gouan, the president of the league, recounted how a mob ransacked the organization's headquarters, hauling off computers, breaking windows and toppling bookshelves, all within sight of police officers who allowed the rampage to happen.</p>
        <p>''They acted with total impunity,'' Mr. N'gouan said. ''There was no one to check their rampage. Is this the society in which we live now? Where thuggery is just accepted as the mode of life?''</p>
        <p>In the north, young foot soldiers of the rebellion seem adrift with their senior commanders having decamped from the chaotic north to take up positions of power in Abidjan. Glassy-eyed young men, some who appear to be just boys, demand money from every car that passes their roadblocks, but often are satisfied with a gulp of water, a cookie or a cigarette.</p>
        <p>''Our discourse has been so debased,'' said Mr. N'gouan. ''This is the legacy of the war.''</p>
        <p>In late May here in Bouaké, frantic preparations were under way for a hugely symbolic event: the national soccer (called football here) team was to play Madagascar in Bouaké's run-down stadium on June 3.</p>
        <p>The only problem was that the stadium had been looted to the studs in the war -- its electrical wiring, plumbing, seats and even toilets ripped out. A new presidential box needed to be built, complete with wet bar and air-conditioning, and the loge section had to be redone for the arriving dignitaries.</p>
        <p>But the biggest problem was the ruined field. Bashirou Balogoun, a landscaper, was hired to resod it, fast. He had employed 250 workers to plant individual blades of grass in the rich black soil he spread, but their water hoses were no match for the vast field. The United Nations pitched in at the last minute with a water truck.</p>
        <p>''This game is a symbol of our unity, so we all have to do our best to make it a success,'' he said. ''We are doing our part to bring the country back together. It is true that it is only a football game, but we hope it is a sign of things to come.''</p>
        <p>Ivory Coast won, 5 to 0.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 20, 2007, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a picture caption in some copies on June 10 with an article about Ivory Coast's political fragility misidentified a religious structure built in Yamoussoukro, the official capital, by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the longtime president, whose death in 1993 helped to precipitate events that led to a civil war. It is a basilica, not a mosque.</p>
