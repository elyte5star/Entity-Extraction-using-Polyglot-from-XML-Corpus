        <p>In response to the increased demand for travel to Middle Eastern cities like Doha, Qatar; Tel Aviv; and Kuwait City, several airlines are adding new routes and destinations to their schedules.</p>
        <p>Qatar Airways (www.qatarairways.com) recently announced it would fly four times a week from Doha International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport, via Geneva (another new destination for the airline), beginning June 26. And starting July 19, Qatar will provide daily flights from Doha to Dulles International Airport near Washington.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines (www.delta.com), which offers nonstop daily flights between Atlanta and Tel Aviv, recently announced that it would offer daily flights from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Tel Aviv starting next March. In addition, Delta is offering flights from Dubai to Atlanta five times a week.</p>
        <p>''The Middle East region offers unique opportunities for Delta to provide customers with service to markets that are strong in business, leisure and ethnic travel,'' said Anthony Black, a Delta spokesman, explaining the company's decision to extend its service in the region.</p>
        <p>United (www.united.com) is taking care of travel to Kuwait, the small country tucked between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. It has been offering daily nonstop flights between Washington and Kuwait since last fall.</p>
