        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Lawrence Kramer is on to something when he suggests that a vibrant concert hall could have much in common with an excellent art museum. But he misses the mark when he laments the lack of a ''classical music equivalent of the contemporary-art market.'' The only reason a contemporary-art market exists is that art can be owned, and collectors have a pecuniary interest in escalating prices. One of the most appealing things about great music is that it belongs to all of us.</p>
