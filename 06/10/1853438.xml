        <p>The vast, icy land of Antarctica, ''the White Continent,'' has attracted explorers since the early days of the 20th century -- from Roald Amundsen and Ernest Shackleton to Robert Falcon Scott and Richard E. Byrd -- each determined to conquer this unconquerable continent.</p>
        <p>The dangers were enormous -- ''For God's sake, hold on, it's got us,'' Shackleton yelled to his crew as a gigantic wave washed over the deck of their 23-foot whaler, the James Caird, nearly capsizing it into the frigid water in 1916 -- and some explorers never came home alive.</p>
        <p>But when the photographer Heidi Schumann went to Antarctica in January this year, on a cruise ship, the World (www.aboardtheworld.com), deprivation and life-threatening conditions were far from the minds of her and her several hundred fellow passengers -- not with the boat's hot tub, heated swimming pool, putting green and 24-hour room service.</p>
        <p>But the lure of Antarctica, with its massive glaciers, strikingly beautiful vistas and, of course, its penquins, remains as powerful as in the days of its first explorers.</p>
