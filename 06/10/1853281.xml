        <p>Did you hear about that lawyer from Georgia, a guy named Andrew Speaker? He's the first person in 44 years to be placed under federal quarantine after he got a drug resistant strain of tuberculosis. The doctors told him he should just stay in Italy.  Which, I believe, is also the Republican's healthcare plan. Sick? Stay in Italy!</p>
        <p>This week, President Bush is at the big G8 summit in Germany, and many Germans are protesting his visit. See, that's when you know things are bad. When the Germans think you are invading too many countries.</p>

        <p>Oh, here's a name from the past: Jack Kevorkian, Dr. Death, the suicide doctor, Jack Kevorkian. He's out of prison, ladies and gentlemen. And he got time off for good behavior. Apparently, he was very helpful on death row.</p>

        <p>Earlier tonight, a Republican presidential debate was held in New Hampshire. You know you're not the party of diversity when even people in New Hampshire are saying, ''Man, those guys are white.''</p>
