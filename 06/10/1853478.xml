        <p>The energetic jazz pianist ERIC REED is a kind of rationalist: He likes limits, structure, standards of talent, strict dimensions. There's no question about what he's handing you from piece to piece, whether it's a little suite, or a bebop song, or a ballad, or a piece of gospel, or something American Songbook-like. But he's found two good foils for his newest band, and both are tenor saxophonists. One, STACY DILLARD, comes more from the open-ended conception of Wayne Shorter; deeply beautiful improvised lines can trail off like ellipses. The other, SEAMUS BLAKE, is just as modern but a little more playful and chameleonic. The Eric Reed Quintet plays at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola this week, continuing a two-week run at the club by Mr. Reed, with two different bands. Tuesday to Sunday, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 60th Street, (212) 258-9595; $30 cover.</p>
        <p>Those following jazz ought to keep an ear on the bassist ESPERANZA SPALDING, who is going about things her own way. She's got good tone and conservatory training, but so does everyone else these days. More important, she already sounds distinct. Essentially she's a singer, using both her instrument and her voice to similar ends. Her musicality is all integrated: The Esperanza Spalding experience is light, melodic, joyful, always sort of minimalist and airborne. Recently she was at the Village Vanguard, playing Bill Evans music with the Spanish guitarist Niño Josele; this week she plays one night with her own trio (Leo Genovese, piano; Lyndon Rochelle, drums). Wednesday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; $20 cover.</p>
