        <p>One bright morning last week, Ilya Zeldin, a crisp light-blue dress shirt tucked into his baggy beige jeans, bounded into the cluttered front office of his new Long Island City company and announced some exciting news.</p>
        <p>''We just got our second repeat customer!'' he shouted, cheeks ruddy, a big smile on his face. It was just the third week of operation for Bread-n-Brie, Mr. Zeldin's online grocery delivery Web site. With its green-and-purple logo, the site is moving into territory that another Long Island City company, FreshDirect, has had virtually to itself for five years.</p>
        <p>Like FreshDirect, Bread-n-Brie has a cheery Web site and offers discounts to first-time customers. But unlike its rival, which maintains a massive warehouse less than a mile from Mr. Zeldin's offices on 32nd Place, Bread-n-Brie does not keep its own inventory. Instead, it makes daily rounds to suppliers around town, among them Parisi Brothers Bakery of Astoria and the Hunts Point produce market, picking up only what customers order.</p>
        <p>''All of the stuff that comes in today will leave today,'' said Mr. Zeldin, 32, standing in the middle of a bare room of empty boxes that would soon be filled with deliveries. Each day, Mr. Zeldin sends all an area's orders to a central neighborhood location and employs delivery people with carts to take each order to the customer on foot. At present, service is limited to the Upper East Side and the area around New York University, although expansion plans are in the works.</p>
        <p>Eighteen months ago, Mr. Zeldin, a Russian immigrant who grew up in Forest Hills and sold colored sand at street festivals as a teenager, began looking into the food delivery market. With a Georgetown business degree and knowledge of past failed services like Kozmo.com and Webvan, Mr. Zeldin established Bread-n-Brie, finding investors and hiring 40 employees. He started receiving orders in late May, sending them out in bags with a quotation from Thomas Jefferson that seems surprising for a grocery company: ''We never repent of having eaten too little.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeldin would not comment on how his business stacks up to FreshDirect, and when asked for comment, FreshDirect would not speak directly about Bread-n-Brie.</p>
        <p>''We are in the service business -- we just happen to serve customers with fresh foods and meals,'' Steve Michaelson, chief executive of FreshDirect, wrote in an e-mail message. ''Our future is based on continuing to offer our customers higher quality products at lower prices to maintain their loyalty.''</p>
        <p>With 700 people registered on the Bread-n-Brie site thus far, Mr. Zeldin said, he is starting small. He also acknowledged that while customers can order Velveeta, feta and provolone cheeses, they still, oddly, cannot order brie. But it, along with thousands of other products, he promised, is coming soon.</p>
