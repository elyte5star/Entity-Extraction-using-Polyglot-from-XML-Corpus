        <p>Unlicensed home contractors would have their equipment seized under legislation proposed last week by the county executive, Andrew J. Spano.</p>
        <p>The county's Consumer Protection Department received 1,500 complaints last year, of which 375 were related to home improvement, department officials said.</p>
        <p>''Home improvement has been the No. 1 complaint for several years and accounts for some of the worst complaints we receive,'' said Gary S. Brown, the department's director.</p>
        <p>In an effort to curtail the number of grievances, Mr. Spano submitted a proposal last week to the county's Board of Legislators under which first-time offenders would be fined $1,000. Offenders would be subject to a fine of $5,000 for a second violation within five years and $10,000 for any subsequent violations within 10 years.</p>
        <p>The bill would also allow county authorities to impound a contractor's vehicle, tools and home improvement equipment, pending the payment of all fines and the securing of a license.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said the legislation was needed not only to boost consumer confidence, but also to recoup lost revenue.</p>
        <p>Officials say the county forfeits approximately $180,000 a year because of the number of contractors who work without a license.</p>
        <p>''This bill is not only pro-consumer, but also pro-business,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>He estimated that 15 percent of the 7,000 contractors operating in Westchester are doing so without a license, which he said hinders the ability of licensed contractors to work on a ''level playing field.''</p>
        <p>Some people caution that a license, which costs $300 for two years, is no guarantee of expertise. The application procedure, while requiring a background check and proof of insurance, does not include a competency exam.</p>
        <p>Edward G. O'Callaghan, 42, who has worked as a licensed contractor throughout the county for 17 years, said that a license was only one measure of a contractor's worth.</p>
        <p>''I've seen nonlicensed contractors do great work and licensed workers do shoddy work,'' he said. ''You can be just as incompetent with a license as without one.''</p>
