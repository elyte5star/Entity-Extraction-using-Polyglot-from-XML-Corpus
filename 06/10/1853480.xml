        <p>No more of ''The Sopranos'' after Sunday night, and television will never be the same. At least until Monday night, when the other HBO family drama, the underrated ''BIG LOVE,'' begins its second season (9 p.m.), with a similar premise (sympathetic mobsters, sympathetic polygamists); a similar style, without most of the sex and violence; and, from top to bottom, an equally good cast. In the season opener, Tony -- excuse me, Bill (Bill Paxton) -- struggles to protect his family from the consequences of the big wife Barb's exposure as a polygamist and becomes obsessed with discovering the rat.</p>
        <p>Summer is high season for basic-cable dramas, with their 8- to 13-week seasons and relatively limited budgets (which seem to enforce a certain level of cheesiness, no matter how good the writing and acting might be). Heavyweights like ''The Closer'' on TNT (June 18) and ''Monk'' on USA (July 13) lie ahead; this week brings us the return of Denis Leary's firehouse passion play, ''RESCUE ME'' (FX, 10 p.m. Wednesday), and the second season of ABC Family's special-child show ''KYLE XY'' (8 p.m. Monday). Many questions will be answered about Kyle's origins in Monday's episode, though not the most pressing one: Why do characters possessed of superhuman intelligence always have such bad haircuts?</p>
        <p>Speaking of ''The Closer,'' a new installment of ''INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO'' (Bravo, 8 p.m. Monday) features Kyra Sedgwick, a k a Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. Let's see if James Lipton has the guts to ask her about that Southern accent.</p>
        <p>For an entirely different type of conversation, check out the new season of the half-hour talk show ''SHARP TALK WITH AL SHARPTON'' (TV One, 1:30 p.m. Saturday), filmed at Levels barbershop in Brooklyn. This week's topic is a certain racial epithet -- the one that served as the title of the 1964 autobiography of Dick Gregory, one of Mr. Sharpton's guests.</p>
