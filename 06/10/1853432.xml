        <p>Canceled flight? Change of plans? Just plain busy? Grab your smart phone or PDA and visit www.tripsync.com to reserve a car, flight or hotel using real-time information. Any portable, Web-enabled device is compatible with the service, which is free. Microsoft Outlook fans should be especially excited about TripSync, as it instantly updates the reserved travel information on each user's calendar.  On July 7, the New Seven Wonders of the World are to be announced in Lisbon. The selections are being made by voters who signed on to www.new7wonders.com; among the nominees are Chichén-Itzá in Mexico, the Great Wall of China and the Acropolis in Greece (below). For those champing at the bit to attend the announcement ceremony, Abreu Tours is offering three-night and six-night packages, starting at $431 a person a night (double occupancy). Participants may choose from a variety of hotels, with optional car rental and airfare (www.abreu-tours.com).  Intrepid Travel, an adventure tourism company based in Australia, is offering six new family itineraries: Europe, Switzerland, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Nepal. The trips are geared toward children ages 6 to 17, and there is a maximum of two children per adult. Rates vary, and don't include airfare and some meals. The Nepal Family Adventure, for example, an 11-day trip that includes white-water rafting, a visit to a crocodile breeding center, elephant rides and camping in the Himalayas, costs $830 a person (www.intrepidtravel.com).  An Avis promotion (www.avis.com) is doubling the number of free iTunes downloads with car rentals. Usually, a customer who rents a vehicle for five days or more receives 10 downloads, but through June, customers get 20.</p>
