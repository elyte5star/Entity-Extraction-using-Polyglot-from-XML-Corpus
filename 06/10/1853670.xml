        <p>Dan Freed, a 36-year-old journalist and a new Brooklyn resident, has long had a knack for finding places to swim. In Chicago, where he grew up, it was Lake Michigan, and during the eight years he lived in East Harlem, he walked to Central Park, to the Lasker Rink and Pool, an unusual hybrid designed for swimming in warm weather and ice skating in the cold.</p>
        <p>About three months ago, around the time their daughter was born, Mr. Freed and his wife bought a house in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, a few blocks from Prospect Park's eastern edge. Mr. Freed spied that park's 46-year-old Wollman Rink, which lies dormant in summer, and wondered: If a combination rink and pool can work in Manhattan, why not here?</p>

        <p>Dan Freed, a 36-year-old journalist and a new Brooklyn resident, has long had a knack for finding places to swim. In Chicago, where he grew up, it was Lake Michigan, and during the eight years he lived in East Harlem, he walked to Central Park, to the Lasker Rink and Pool, an unusual hybrid designed for swimming in warm weather and ice skating in the cold.</p>
        <p>About three months ago, around the time their daughter was born, Mr. Freed and his wife bought a house in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, a few blocks from Prospect Park's eastern edge. Mr. Freed spied that park's 46-year-old Wollman Rink, which lies dormant in summer, and wondered: If a combination rink and pool can work in Manhattan, why not here?</p>
        <p>He asked around a bit, found out that the Prospect Park Alliance and city government were already in the midst of planning a new recreation center to replace the rink, and started a petition to have a combination rink and pool included. As of last week, he had gathered more than 280 names online, and another 90, he said, at K-Dog and Dunebuggy, a local cafe.</p>
        <p>''I think a pool there would be used a ton,'' he said. The idea, though, has had a rough couple of weeks. At a public forum held by the Prospect Park Alliance on May 30, Mr. Freed encountered skepticism from skating enthusiasts, who favored the two new outdoor rinks planned for the site, and from park planners. The planners have been working on the project for years, have already selected their architects and have lined up $25 million in city money toward the $50 million needed for the planned rinks, 38,000-square-foot building, landscaping and cafe.</p>
        <p>Tupper Thomas, the park's administrator, did not rule out building a pool in the park someday -- possibly an indoor one, possibly at the athletic field area known as the Parade Grounds -- but said last week that it would not work as part of the current rink renovation.</p>
        <p>''If we even considered doing a pool in any place there,'' Ms. Thomas said, ''the additional cost would be way over the top beyond what I can raise.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of Mr. Freed's petition, she suggested that some people who signed had not fully considered the logistics of the idea, and she added, ''Most of the people who have done a follow-up note to us had no idea there were any other pools in Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freed said last week that his pool idea had seemed more promising before he knew about the other plans for the site. Still, he was not satisfied with the official response.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm asking them why,'' he said, ''and they're saying, 'Because I said so.' ''</p>
        <p>He had not given up, though, on convincing Ms. Thomas. ''I think after meeting me she seemed to be a little bit more second-guessing herself, saying, 'I want to take another look and see if this is doable,' '' he said.</p>
