        <p>Whenever huge calamities strike abroad -- the tsunami in Asia in 2004, say -- New Yorkers know that in their ethnically mixed city there is probably an enclave directly linked to the tragedy. This pattern applies to smaller events, too, like a recent bus crash in Pennsylvania that echoed loudly throughout Chinatown.</p>
        <p>At 3:30 a.m. May 20, a bus carrying 36 passengers from Chicago to New York went out of control on Interstate 80 in Clearfield County, Pa. The bus zigzagged across the highway and ended up on its side on the road's embankment, leaving 2 people dead and 32 others injured. The cause of the accident is under investigation.</p>
        <p>The bus offered the kind of economical interstate transportation popular among Chinese immigrants, and this particular vehicle had many Chinatown residents on it, according to John Yong, a New York lawyer for several of the injured passengers.</p>
        <p>''They come to New York as a base; some of them rent a bed and go to another state to work,'' Mr. Yong said. But he said that ''the jobs are never long-term, and they always return to New York.''</p>
        <p>The accident made headline news every day in Chinatown newspapers and television, and it was the talk of the neighborhood. ''To what extent do they know about it?'' Mr. Yong asked, rhetorically, about local awareness. ''They know about it absolutely.''</p>
        <p>Guo Fengzhu's account of what happened on that rain-soaked morning was fuzzy, like others'. One minute, she was sleeping on a long-haul bus; the next, she was jolted awake by the sounds of chaos.</p>
        <p>''I heard screams,'' recalled Ms. Guo, 51. ''I smelled something very strong -- it was gasoline. People around me kept saying we have to get out of the bus, because it might catch fire.'' At their urging, she started crawling her way out.</p>
        <p>With injuries to her right shoulder and neck, Ms. Guo, who had been living in Ohio and working at a restaurant there, will be moving in with her mother and sister in Chinatown while she recuperates.</p>
        <p>Some of the passengers were illegal immigrants, and for them the accident raised one of their worst fears: having their status revealed.</p>
        <p>''People I met at the hospital kept asking me two questions: 'Will they find out that I am illegal?' and 'How would I pay my hospital bills?' '' said Steven Wong, director of the Lin Ze Xu Foundation of U.S.A., a community group serving immigrants in Chinatown. ''On the day of the accident, I kept getting calls from different family members. They think there'll be immigration officers at the hospital and were too afraid to go there to visit.''</p>
