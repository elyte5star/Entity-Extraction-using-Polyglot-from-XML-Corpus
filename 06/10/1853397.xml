        <p>A New Hampshire woman was injured Tuesday afternoon when her car hit a 500-pound moose on the Merritt Parkway in New Canaan.</p>
        <p>The driver, Kim Pitcher, 51, of New London, N.H., was taken to Norwalk Hospital. She was in serious condition on Thursday, said a hospital spokeswoman, Sharon Simon.</p>
        <p>The moose, a young bull, had to be destroyed at the scene by the State Department of Environmental Protection's conservation police.</p>
        <p>According to the department, the woman's 1997 Subaru Impreza hit the moose about 3:51 p.m. in a southbound lane between Exits 36 and 37.</p>
        <p>Environmental department officials said they believed the moose was the same one spotted last week in Southbury and later by the Hemlock Reservoir near the town line of Easton and Fairfield.</p>
        <p>Environmental officials had issued an alert to motorists on Monday afternoon that the moose was seen close to the Merritt Parkway in the Fairfield area.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day on Tuesday, environmental department officers unsuccessfully tried to tranquilize the moose in Darien.</p>
        <p>The accident in New Canaan was the fourth in the state this year involving a moose and an automobile, according the environmental protection department. The other three were in Barkhamsted, Canaan and Thompson.</p>
        <p>Dennis Schain, a spokesman for the department, estimated that there are about 100 moose in the state, mostly in the northwest corner. But he said those that wander can cover up to 20 miles in a day.</p>
        <p>''Occasionally, nature can cause a moose to set off,'' Mr. Schain said. ''However, it is unusual for one to go this far.''</p>
        <p>The agency said a fully grown moose can weigh as much as a 1,000 pounds.</p>
