        <p>TRIPLING TIGER  CURTIS GRANDERSON of the Tigers leads the American League in triples with 12. If he ends up as the leader, he will break Carl Crawford's streak of three consecutive years leading the A.L.</p>
        <p>STUCK AT 99  Mark Buehrle of the White Sox (2-3, 3.99 earned run average) is set to start against the Astros today. It will be his eighth try at his 100th career victory; his last win came April 23.</p>
        <p>ROAD TEST  With their victory Thursday against the Blue Jays, the Devil Rays won consecutive road games for the first time in almost a year. The Devil Rays were a major-league-worst 20-61 on the road in 2006, including 3-33 after July 1. They had not won back-to-back road games since June 16 and 17 last year at Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>NOT BAD COMPANY  Steve Finley was designated for assignment by the Rockies, probably ending his 19-year career. He is one of six players with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases. The others are Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Andre Dawson, Bobby Bonds and Reggie Sanders.</p>
        <p>NO LUCK FOR SUTTON  Curt Schilling of the Red Sox lost a chance at his first no-hitter Thursday against the Athletics when Shannon Stewart singled with two out in the ninth. It was Schilling's 425th career start. Don Sutton started the most games, 756, without throwing a no-hitter.</p>
        <p>PLAYERS TO WATCH</p>
        <p>The Dodgers' Juan Pierre, below, has hit .214 this month. He is hitting .269 over all, with an on-base percentage of .297. Pierre has hit below .280 only once in his major league career. But he also has not hit .300, something he accomplished in four of his first five seasons, since 2004. Despite his downturn, Pierre said last week that he would not do anything different to break a recent fly-ball tendency.</p>
        <p>Looking for a spark, the Royals promoted Joey Gathright from Class AAA, where he was hitting .328 with 21 stolen bases. Gathright has hit better than .300 in the minors before, but it has not translated to success in the big leagues. But he had six hits in his first 11 at-bats after the promotion.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh center fielder Chris Duffy hit .292 after being moved to the No. 2 spot in the order May 23, but that was not enough to stop the Pirates from starting the Rajai Davis experiment. Davis had a 21-game hitting streak at Class AAA Indianapolis, with a .318 average and 27 stolen bases. Duffy, a left-handed batter, was hitting .239 over all. Manager Jim Tracy has promised it will not be a platoon, but Davis, a right-handed batter, hit better against right-handers. The struggles of the top prospect Andrew McCutchen at Class AA may have the Pirates looking for a longer-term solution in center.</p>
