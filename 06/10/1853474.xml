        <p>American art-world eyes are turning eastward to Europe right now as a string of summer extravaganzas -- the Venice Biennale, Documenta 12, the Basel Art Fair and the Münster Sculpture Project -- open in carefully calibrated succession through mid-June.</p>
        <p>So why not plot an alternative, less crowded course and look west, to Southern California, which has its own festival of summer shows? In Los Angeles you can catch ''EDEN'S EDGE: FIFTEEN L.A. ARTISTS'' at the Hammer Museum, a generational sampling of local talent. From the sculptor Ken Price (born 1935), to the installation artist Jason Rhoades (1965-2006), to bright 30-somethings like Anna Sew Hoy and Elliott Hundley, strange beauty is the connecting link. Through Sept. 2, (310) 443-7000, hammer.ucla.edu.</p>
        <p>A similar beauty is also the link among certain figures who might be considered the mothers of almost all American contemporary art: women who came of aesthetic age during the women's movement. Three of them share the honors in ''IDENTITY THEFT: ELEANOR ANTIN, LYNN HERSHMAN AND SUZY LAKE, 1972-78'' at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, and each is distinctively great in performance-based work: Ms. Antin with her various enacted ''selves'' (ballerina, bearded king); Ms. Hershman with her lifelong alter ego, Roberta Breitmore; and Ms. Lake with her cosmetically altered self-portraits. Through Aug. 11, (310) 586-6488, smmoa.org.</p>
        <p>You'll also find these artists in ''WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION'' at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where they're joined by the painter Mary Heilmann, whose first American retrospective is at the Orange County Museum of Art (through Aug. 26). The survey covers some four decades, from Ms. Heilmann's early West Coast days to her many years in and out of sight in New York. With her high-color, faux-casual abstract pictures, she's very much in sight everywhere now, and the retrospective will be heading eastward to New York next year. Through July 16, Geffen Contemporary at Museum of Contemporary Art, moca.org. Through Aug. 26, Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, Calif., ocma.net.</p>
