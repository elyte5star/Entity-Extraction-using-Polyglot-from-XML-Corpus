        <p>Well, it's that time of year when the big novels are rolled out, and here they come: barrels of books by big-name writers like Michael Connelly, Janet Evanovich, Robert B. Parker, Lee Child and Mary Higgins Clark. But with publishers now pushing some best-selling authors to produce a book or two (or even three) a year, even the most faithful reader can feel the need for a palate cleanser. Personally, I find that nothing restores my devotion to genre novels, or my respect for their sheer craft, than plunging into a traditional whodunit or a complicated procedural.</p>
        <p>Something like Jeffery Deaver's intricately plotted thriller THE SLEEPING DOLL (Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.95) serves me just fine. Taking his own kind of break here, Deaver leaves his regular series detective, Lincoln Rhyme, back in New York to putter with the forensic evidence that engages his brilliant intellect. Instead, Deaver turns the story over to a new protagonist, Kathryn Dance, the California interrogation expert who made a brief but strong contribution to his previous Lincoln Rhyme novel, ''The Cold Moon.'' Although Dance's specialty is kinesics -- the scientific evaluation of the hidden clues in body language -- she's just as obsessive about minutiae as Rhyme, and her first case is a dazzling mental contest with a charismatic cult leader, Daniel Pell, who has escaped from prison and found a new slave to carry out his homicidal agenda.</p>

        <p>Well, it's that time of year when the big novels are rolled out, and here they come: barrels of books by big-name writers like Michael Connelly, Janet Evanovich, Robert B. Parker, Lee Child and Mary Higgins Clark. But with publishers now pushing some best-selling authors to produce a book or two (or even three) a year, even the most faithful reader can feel the need for a palate cleanser. Personally, I find that nothing restores my devotion to genre novels, or my respect for their sheer craft, than plunging into a traditional whodunit or a complicated procedural.</p>
        <p>Something like Jeffery Deaver's intricately plotted thriller THE SLEEPING DOLL (Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.95) serves me just fine. Taking his own kind of break here, Deaver leaves his regular series detective, Lincoln Rhyme, back in New York to putter with the forensic evidence that engages his brilliant intellect. Instead, Deaver turns the story over to a new protagonist, Kathryn Dance, the California interrogation expert who made a brief but strong contribution to his previous Lincoln Rhyme novel, ''The Cold Moon.'' Although Dance's specialty is kinesics -- the scientific evaluation of the hidden clues in body language -- she's just as obsessive about minutiae as Rhyme, and her first case is a dazzling mental contest with a charismatic cult leader, Daniel Pell, who has escaped from prison and found a new slave to carry out his homicidal agenda.</p>
        <p>Because Pell is too wily to leave any physical evidence behind, the only way Dance and her colleagues at the California Bureau of Investigation can try to predict his moves is to interrogate the victims he has duped and the surviving members of his former ''family.'' With Dance analyzing every verbal and physical expression for stress clues, all talk becomes treacherous.</p>
        <p>The attractive Dance has plenty of personal business going on (including a nice hobby as a folk music ''song catcher'') and could easily carry a new series, but Pell, who with good reason fancies himself a modern-day Pied Piper, is the main attraction here. ''What a total high it was to practice his art once again,'' he exults after killing a victim so gullible she practically walks into his arms. This disturbingly intelligent monster takes us deep into his confidence, sharing both the philosophy and the diabolical techniques of an utterly ruthless cult leader: ''Nothing made him happier than transforming someone into a creature of his own making.'' Master manipulator that he is, Deaver shows us exactly how it's done -- and makes us admire his own literary artistry.</p>
        <p>When it comes to a classic British puzzle mystery -- the kind where the lead detective leaves the forensic details to the clever young cops working the computers, then figures out the solution in his head -- Peter Lovesey is your man. His latest, THE SECRET HANGMAN (Soho, $24), is a special treat because Peter Diamond, the prickly genius-in-residence on the Bath police force, hasn't been entirely himself since his wife was murdered back in ''Diamond Dust.'' The inspector couldn't even take credit for the inventive sleuthing in ''The Circle,'' the most recent novel in this series, because a colleague delivered the coup de grÃce.</p>
        <p>Although Diamond doesn't seem as irascible as usual (possibly thanks to his budding romance with an uninhibited woman named Paloma), he certainly has all his wits about him. And he'll need them for a case in which the apparent murder-suicide of a woman and the estranged partner who fathered her two children turns out to be a double murder by a killer who has struck before and may strike again. Writing in a style that accepts no boundary between morbid and merry, Lovesey proves that the traditional puzzle mystery is always a bit of fun and games.</p>
        <p>The plot mechanics of the locked-room mystery can be infernally tricky, but Christopher Fowler manipulates the machinery with droll wit in WHITE CORRIDOR (Bantam, $24) by staging the murder of a police pathologist in the locked autopsy room of his own morgue. Arthur Bryant and John May, the oldest and crankiest detectives on the London force (and the eccentric leaders of its Peculiar Crimes Unit), are forced to solve this curious case by cellphone while trapped in the wilds of Dartmoor in a raging blizzard. To make matters all the more interesting, one of the motorists stranded in the pileup of disabled vehicles is a killer.</p>
        <p>Bryant's enthusiasm for the occult (the detectives were en route to a spiritualists' convention) and his arcane knowledge of bizarre historical ephemera (like the ''London craze for electrocuting yourself in the mid-18th century'') add yet more zest to this offbeat series. But the sleight of hand involved in resolving the parallel plots transcends oddity, showing Fowler to be a master of classical form.</p>
        <p>The cozy mystery, which aims to charm as much as challenge, has a graceful practitioner of that artful dodge in Louise Penny. ''A Quebec winter could both enchant and kill,'' she notes slyly in A FATAL GRACE (St. Martin's Minotaur, $23.95), in which she returns to the village of Three Pines, featured in her first novel, ''Still Life,'' to present an idyllic view of that peaceful hamlet at the Christmas season. But before the eerie serenity of the place can become too stifling, Penny disrupts the picturesque curling matches and réveillon parties with a dandy murder -- of a cruel and overbearing woman nobody mourns -- that demands real brain work from Armand Gamache, chief inspector of the SÃ reté du Québec.</p>
        <p>Although it's sad to see that Penny has slipped into the cozy convention of idealizing the adorable natives, it's gratifying to note that one of these stock characters, an ''elderly, wizened, bitter poet'' named Ruth Zardo, remains resistant to this onslaught of sentimentality.</p>
