        <p>Do you like to read while you nosh, poring over the newspaper or peeling through a paperback? If so, the John Bale Book Company, a two-story antiquarian's delight of used and rare books, may be your dream cafe.</p>
        <p>The honey-oak bookshelves running the length of Bale's avocado-green pegboard walls inspire the self-imposed hush of a well-loved library. Yet the atmosphere is comfortably casual, due in no small part to the dominant presence on the ground floor of a food counter and, across from it, 8 tables and 35 seats.</p>

        <p>Do you like to read while you nosh, poring over the newspaper or peeling through a paperback? If so, the John Bale Book Company, a two-story antiquarian's delight of used and rare books, may be your dream cafe.</p>
        <p>The honey-oak bookshelves running the length of Bale's avocado-green pegboard walls inspire the self-imposed hush of a well-loved library. Yet the atmosphere is comfortably casual, due in no small part to the dominant presence on the ground floor of a food counter and, across from it, 8 tables and 35 seats.</p>
        <p>Unlike most libraries, there is often background music: Frank Sinatra on one recent occasion, a live pianist on another.</p>
        <p>John Bale offers a broad selection of caffeinated drinks, from chai latte ($2.85 for 12 ounces) to espresso breve ($3) to a plain old cup of joe ($1.50).</p>
        <p>Where it departs from most bookstore cafes is in its breakfast fare, from an English muffin ($1.20) and a fresh fruit cup ($2.65) at the light end of the spectrum to freshly baked muffins ($1.60), oatmeal ($2) and egg sandwiches ($2.50) at the more caloric end.</p>
        <p>At lunch, you'll find soups and stews ($3.50 for 12 ounces, $4.50 for 16 ounces) and a quartet of salads (the Waldorf is $3.80). For the numerous sandwich possibilities, choose among a half-dozen breads (or Portuguese rolls), select a filling (ham, turkey, roast beef, liverwurst, crab salad and more), add lettuce and tomato and you have a $5.95 lunch fit for an earl. Condiments, for 50 cents more, include roasted peppers, avocado, onion and cucumber.</p>
        <p>Can't decide? No problem: Bale's also combines a small soup with a garden salad ($6.50) or a half sandwich ($6.99).</p>
        <p>The John Bale Book Company, 158 Grand Street, Waterbury; (203) 591-1801 or www.johnbalebooks.com. Open Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
