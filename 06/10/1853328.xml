        <p>One senior member of this island's most hard-line Islamic group said he loves American television and hopes to send his son off to university in the States. Another said that when he is not praying or preaching, he plays in a steel drum band.</p>
        <p>Denying that their group, Jamaat al Muslimeen, was tied to any plot to bomb a New York City airport, members this week portrayed themselves as both Islamists and islanders, devoted to God but also part of the multicultural mix that defines the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
        <p>Even as they did, the fiery imam who has long been the Jamaat's public face ducked out the back of the mosque. That man, Yasin Abu Bakr, who once led a violent coup attempt here in 1990, faces trial next week for sedition and extortion and oversees a group with a reputation for thuggishness.</p>
        <p>Those who have studied the group consider it a stretch to mention Jamaat al Muslimeen and Al Qaeda in the same breath. But United States authorities say it was an obvious place for the four suspects now accused of plotting to bomb Kennedy International Airport to turn when they were looking for Islamist support.</p>
        <p>''They're certainly a militant group with a history of criminality and violence,'' said Chris Zambelis, a counterterrorism analyst with the Jamestown Foundation in Washington. ''But their focus has been strictly on Trinidadian issues.</p>
        <p>''I'd describe them as a local criminal gang,'' he added, ''not any kind of global terrorist organization. It's a very radical fringe group, not at all representative of the Trinidadian Muslim community.''</p>
        <p>Court documents suggest that Mr. Abu Bakr met in May with one of the suspects, Abdel Nur, a Guyanese national who surrendered to the police on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Islamic leader, the court documents say, suggested a follow-up meeting ''to discuss the plan in detail'' and to give Mr. Abu Bakr time to do further checks on the participants. Before any such meeting took place, authorities in New York and Port of Spain arrested the four on charges of planning to bomb the airport's fuel line.</p>
        <p>Jamaat officials said two of the suspects had visited their mosque, but they dismissed the notion that a real terrorist operation was in progress and that their group was part of it.</p>
        <p>''We don't subscribe to that -- this randomly blowing up of people,'' said Kala Akii-Bua, Jamaat's social welfare officer and the leader of a steel drum orchestra, adding, ''I have a lot of respect for the security forces of America.''</p>
        <p>Jamaat al Muslimeen, which has about 1,000 members in Trinidad, has long been the region's most controversial Islamic organization.</p>
        <p>At what was perhaps the height of its radicalism nearly two decades ago, Jamaat established ties with Libya when it was considered by Washington to be a terrorist state and dispatched armed fighters to take over Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament.</p>
        <p>Since that raid, which left two dozen people dead, the prime minister with a bullet wound to the leg and the police headquarters in ashes after a car bombing, Jamaat claims to have transformed itself.</p>
        <p>''Our organization has not turned one corner but many corners in recent years,'' Mr. Akii-Bua said.</p>
        <p>After seizing power for about a week, Mr. Abu Bakr and his 100 or so followers were charged with murder, treason and other charges stemming from the coup. But a court dropped the charges after ruling that the men had been pardoned by the then-president.</p>
        <p>''We had never had that kind of experience,'' said Brinsley Samaroo, a government minister at the time of the coup who is now a historian at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. ''It was totally traumatizing. It was the moment we lost our innocence as a country. People saw the impossible happen.''</p>
        <p>But even since his pardon, Mr. Abu Bakr, who was born Lennox Phillips and converted to Islam while studying in Canada in the 1970s, has repeatedly run afoul of the authorities here.</p>
        <p>Next week Mr. Abu Bakr faces trial on charges of sedition and extortion, stemming from an explosive sermon he delivered in 2005, threatening war against fellow Muslims who did not follow the Islamic law of handing over part of their income.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the 2005 fiery sermon, the authorities raided the Jamaat compound in search of what they suspected was a large cache of weapons hidden underground. Using a jackhammer to bash in Mr. Abu Bakr's office and dig through his concrete floor, police officers found a rifle, a grenade and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.</p>
        <p>In another case, a member of Jamaat was found guilty in Miami in 2005 of trying to smuggle 70 submachine guns and 10 silencers to Trinidad from the United States.</p>
        <p>In 2006, Mr. Abu Bakr was found not guilty of ordering the murder of two former members of Jamaat.</p>
        <p>Not least, he has been accused by some of fomenting this island's ethnic and religious divisions.</p>
        <p>Jamaat is made up of Trinidadians of African descent who converted to Islam in the 1980s after the rise of the Nation of Islam in the United States. Trinidad is about evenly split between blacks and people who trace their ancestry to India, most of them Hindu but also some Muslim, who are 6 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>Trinidad and Tobago's political parties are largely race-based, with Afro-Caribbeans dominating the ruling People's National Movement and Indians making up the bulk of the United National Congress.</p>
        <p>A new party, Congress of the People, has sought to bridge the racial divide but it was embarrassed this week when it discovered that one of the suspects, Kareem Ibrahim, was on its membership rolls.</p>
        <p>The same racial divide found in politics exists in the island's religious communities, with most of the country's churches, mosques and temples either black or Indian.</p>
        <p>Jamaat said it is focused on domestic matters, assisting the many people who are left out of the economic boom here and shielding its faithful from Trinidad's famed Carnival.</p>
        <p>Since Jamaat is made up of converts, most participated in the pre-Lenten revelry in the past. ''I had been to Carnival before I became a Muslim,'' said Gail Alonso, who is Mr. Abu Bakr's secretary. ''Now I'm a Muslim, and I don't think I'm missing anything.''</p>
        <p>Children though are bused on excursions to other parts of the island to keep them away from the drinking and dancing, which pass right by the mosque.</p>
        <p>''Allah says, to them, their ways, and to us, ours,'' said Worris Ballack, a member of the mosque's executive board and a devotee of American television. ''We don't take part in the nakedness in the streets. Our women are covered. We don't follow the wild culture -- and that wild culture here in Trinidad is very wild.''</p>
