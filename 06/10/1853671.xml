        <p>Five police officers thrust their fists into the center of a circle and bellowed: ''One, two, three. Defense!'' The basketball game erupted into a storm of furious dribbling and decisive dunks. Sneakers screeched on the gleaming gym floor.</p>
        <p>Robert Fagan paced along the sidelines, intently watching his boys face off against the police officers on a recent Thursday afternoon at the Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice in Morrisania. The game was unusual because Mr. Fagan's team, the Bombers, was composed entirely of young men, 16 to 24, who had been convicted of nonviolent misdemeanors -- and whose previous dealings with the police have not necessarily been noteworthy for sportsmanship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fagan is a 38-year-old case manager for Bronx Community Solutions, a nonprofit group that looks for alternatives to jail time for people convicted of low-level crime. He hatched the idea for a basketball league facing ex-offenders against police officers in the tense aftermath of the police shooting of Sean Bell, who died Nov. 25 in Queens in a fusillade of 50 police bullets that also wounded two of Mr. Bell's friends.</p>
        <p>''When Sean Bell happened, there was a lot of uproar,'' said Mr. Fagan, who is slender and bald and has sea-green eyes. ''Perceptions of youth toward police were kind of distorted, and I thought this would maybe change perceptions. Police are people in the community like us.''</p>
        <p>With their badges stowed away, the police officers, from the 46th Precinct, struggled mightily to defend their record, having beaten the Bombers in two previous games. But the Bombers were up, 39-20, at halftime.</p>
        <p>''Gentlemen, the spectators are in the stands, not on the court,'' yelled Warren Thompson, the police team's coach.</p>
        <p>In the bleachers awaiting his turn on the court was Kenneth Kearney, a 23-year-old Bronx native who had spent two years in an upstate prison on a drug charge before being rearrested earlier this year for drinking alcohol outdoors from an open container. He credited the basketball games with taming his view of the police.</p>
        <p>"We somehow come together; we all talk to each other," said Mr. Kearney, whose burly frame was beaded with sweat. "They probably don't have to come out here and play with us, but I feel like it's good that they choose to.''</p>
        <p>Greg Berman, director of the Center for Court Innovation, a public-private partnership that oversees the Bronx initiative, said the games chip away at the wall of suspicion between citizens and the police.</p>
        <p>''It would be naïve to think everyone goes into this singing 'Kumbaya,' but I would argue that these informal encounters are very powerful,'' Mr. Berman said. ''They humanize both halves of the equation.''</p>
        <p>In the last few minutes of the game, an officer scored an elegant shot from behind the foul line. The Bombers stole the ball in a flurry of limbs and steered it to their side of the court. The final seconds were counted down until the Bombers won, 67-50. Everyone clustered at center court to exchange gentlemanly handshakes and grins.</p>
