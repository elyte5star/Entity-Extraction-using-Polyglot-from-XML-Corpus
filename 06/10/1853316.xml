        <p>I was born in London in 1924 to middle-class parents. The custom in those days in England was to hire a well-trained English nanny (with excellent references) to raise the children. My mother was a dedicated and valuable community volunteer but insecure in her role as a mother.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Nanny Nightmare? Living Without One,'' by Liesl Schillinger (Books of Style, May 27):</p>
        <p>I was born in London in 1924 to middle-class parents. The custom in those days in England was to hire a well-trained English nanny (with excellent references) to raise the children. My mother was a dedicated and valuable community volunteer but insecure in her role as a mother.</p>
        <p>My sister and I adored our nanny and I believe I am a much more confident and contented person because of her dedicated and experienced care. I doubt if my insecure, anxious mother would have been as successful. But my parents' marriage was a loving one and they were devoted parents and grandparents.</p>
        <p>When Nanny died I felt her loss very deeply; when Mother died at 77 a few years later I was saddened, feeling as if I had lost a really good friend. I have always wondered whether Mother regretted (or realized) that in my heart Nanny was my ''real'' mother. Consequently, my husband and I did not have nannies for the children. I guess I was selfish and did not want to share their love.</p>
