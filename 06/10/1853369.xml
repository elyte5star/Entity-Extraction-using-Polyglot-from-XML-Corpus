        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Bronx's large German population in the 1890s was only one reason that a fountain commemorating one of Germany's greatest poets was placed there (Streetscapes: ''Sturm und Drang Over a Memorial to Heinrich Heine,'' May 27). The site, overlooking 161st Street near the Grand Concourse, was planned as the gateway entrance, to be named Concourse Plaza. The plans called for a fountain in the plaza's center. Fortuitously, here was a fountain seeking a home, available at no cost to the taxpayer, and it was grabbed for the purpose by the thrifty Bronx officeholders of the era.</p>
