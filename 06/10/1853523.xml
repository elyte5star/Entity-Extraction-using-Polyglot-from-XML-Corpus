        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Concert Hall? How About Music Museum?'' [June 3]:</p>
        <p>In his stimulating essay Lawrence Kramer asks why classical music still matters. I would be more specific: Why does going to a classical music concert still matter, since the music may be heard anywhere via iPod or CD? I've performed classical music in concert and have recorded the same music. The difference is huge. At a concert there are likely to be more risks taken, more new ideas instantly realized, and more deeply emotional playing in response to an audience. This is not the case in the studio, where care and consistency are the rule. No matter what electronic apparatus we have in our homes, or carry with us, the concert hall is the beating heart of classical music, and it matters enormously.</p>
