        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Boy Wonders of Lacrosse,'' June 3: I couldn't help wondering after reading Huntington High School Coach Paul McDermott's comment about Rhamel and Shamel Bratton developing lacrosse moves that ''aren't taught'' whether they will match those of another pair of twin brothers, Gary and Paul Gait, whose skills revolutionized lacrosse during their college years. If the Brattons turn out to be greater at Virginia than the Gaits were at Syracuse two decades ago, then we will have seen not only a pair of African-American stars in a predominantly white game, but also two individuals who revolutionized the sport once again.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Rhamel Bratton referred to lacrosse as being more laid-back than football, but perhaps that is only in terms of organized practice time. In execution, lacrosse is anything but laid-back. It is one of the most demanding team sports and players have to be excellent athletes; the Bratton twins are tremendous.</p>
