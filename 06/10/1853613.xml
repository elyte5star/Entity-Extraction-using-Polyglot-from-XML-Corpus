        <p>1. CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD -- Take a letter -- kapow! Hold his calls -- blammo! By day, he makes corporate villains tremble in their dress socks; by night, they're trembling barefoot. Ted Baker silk neckties ($75 at Ted Baker London in New York, 212-343-8989) and silver cuff links ($85 to $95 at Bloomingdale's in New York, 212-705-2000). C. O. Bigelow's new men's foaming shave gel, hair and body wash, and cologne, $10 to $19.50 at bathandbodyworks.com).</p>
        <p>2. DADOLESCENT -- When Mom said for the zillionth time not to throw balls in the house, she wasn't talking to the kids. Some fathers just won't grow up; if you can't beat him, join him. Japanese Kurakari cardboard windup toys. Some cutting, folding and gluing required for assembly. ($16 at Aplusrstore.com.)</p>
        <p>3. THE MODFATHER -- He's the kind of guy who will spin through a store and -- badda-bing! -- blow a paycheck on a closetful of clothes. Give him a wardrobe he can't refuse. Rag &amp; Bone charcoal lightweight wool Slim Suit ($660 at Barneys New York, 212-826-8900).</p>
        <p>4. TECHNO POP -- Watch him buzz with tech-citement whenever there's an electronic device within 30 paces. He's the only man you know who really celebrates Motherboard's Day. Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W200 camera with Face Detection focus technology, low-light sensitivity and in-camera retouching ($399.99 at ritzcamera.com.)</p>
        <p>5. THE BRAINIAC -- He helped with your calculus homework and never broke a sweat; he can name the gaffer on any movie after 1972; he used the word ''palimpsest'' a full decade before Gore Vidal made it trendy. Phaidon Colour Library Series, 40 volumes of art history, each containing 48 full-color plates ($398 at thisisauto.com or 212-229-2292 to order. Delivery may take one to two weeks; the store will issue a gift card, pre-arrival.)</p>
        <p>6. BURNING MAN -- So what if he dirties every pot, plate and utensil in the entire house just to cook his lucky omelet? He's on fire! L-Press Juicer with orange rubberized handles ($100 at momastore.com); cotton cook's apron with built-in padded oven mitts by Royal VKB (in navy or olive, $25 at Aplusrstore.com).</p>
        <p>7. SUPERDAD -- He coached your Little League team for three years -- even though you dropped out after a month to join the drama club. At least you'll always have them Mets. For him, the Gym Kit from Zegna Sport: a cotton T-shirt, microfiber pants, shorts and a jacket which converts into a handy gym bag ($445 at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, 212-753-4000, and Ermenegildo Zegna in New York, 212-421-4488). Panoptx sunglasses with shatter-resistant lenses and rubber eye seals, which allow them to double as sports goggles ($79 to $250 at panoptx.com).</p>
