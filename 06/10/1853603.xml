        <p>Murray Hill Co-op  $795,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 244 East 30th Street (between Second and Third Avenues), #1B</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath co-op. Paul Zumoff, the Corcoran Group (718) 210-4025; www.corcoran.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,154 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: The apartment faces south onto a tree-filled garden and an ivy-covered wall. Nice touches include decorative fireplaces and three windows in the second bedroom.</p>
        <p>CONS: Despite having two bedrooms and two baths, this apartment does not feel large.</p>
        <p>Split-Level Cape  $1,799,000</p>
        <p>QUEENS: 110 Malba Drive, Malba</p>
        <p>A 1949 four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath home with 2,600 square feet of space, central air-conditioning, eat-in kitchen with oak floors and a garage in the basement. Anthony Carollo, Carollo Real Estate (718) 747-7747; www.carollorealestate.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $7,822 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: A den off the kitchen receives lots of natural light. The site affords partial views of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.</p>
        <p>CONS: A yellow wall-to-wall carpet in the living room and a lime-green one in the dining room might not be to everyone's taste. The master bath opens onto a hallway, not the master bedroom.</p>
        <p>Chelsea Co-op  $1,200,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 465 West 23rd Street (at 10th Avenue), #11B</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: 249 Degraw Street (near Clinton Street)</p>

        <p>TAXES: $4,600 a year; no common charge</p>
        <p>PROS: With its original stained-glass windows and rose-covered facade intact, this condo is intriguingly contemporary, a mix of cozy nooks, unexpected angles and an enormous living space with a floating glass staircase and 30-foot ceiling.</p>
        <p>CONS: The secluded decked garden in back can be reached only from the front sidewalk via a pathway at the side of the building.</p>
        <p>Italianate Victorian  $789,000</p>
