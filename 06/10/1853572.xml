        <p>Mystery meat is one thing, mystery ice cream quite another. Especially when the cryptic confection in question -- a flavor known at Zita's Homemade Ice Cream only as 91716 -- is a just-right amalgam of chocolate-covered pretzel bits, caramel, peanut butter and chocolate chips in a rich vanilla ice cream base ($2.10 for a scoop).</p>
        <p>''If I give you a hint, you're probably going to guess it. And we don't want to give away what it means,'' said Peter Elefante, who has owned Zita's since 2004, taking over for his father and uncle, who established the spacious, no-frills parlor in 2000. Though he and his squad of teenage counter helpers are tight-lipped on the meaning of 91716 -- is it an ancestor's birth date? Someone's locker combination? -- they have no problem discussing how 35 other flavors sold on the premises get to be so tantalizing.</p>

        <p>Mystery meat is one thing, mystery ice cream quite another. Especially when the cryptic confection in question -- a flavor known at Zita's Homemade Ice Cream only as 91716 -- is a just-right amalgam of chocolate-covered pretzel bits, caramel, peanut butter and chocolate chips in a rich vanilla ice cream base ($2.10 for a scoop).</p>
        <p>''If I give you a hint, you're probably going to guess it. And we don't want to give away what it means,'' said Peter Elefante, who has owned Zita's since 2004, taking over for his father and uncle, who established the spacious, no-frills parlor in 2000. Though he and his squad of teenage counter helpers are tight-lipped on the meaning of 91716 -- is it an ancestor's birth date? Someone's locker combination? -- they have no problem discussing how 35 other flavors sold on the premises get to be so tantalizing.</p>
        <p>Kong, for instance, is chocolate chips, caramel and pecans swirled into banana ice cream, and it is one of the store's best sellers. But only after the staff tempts you with the chocolate, caramel and nuts do they mention the banana ice cream part. ''Nobody likes the sound of banana ice cream,'' Mr. Elefante said. ''But it starts sounding good when you add that other stuff in.''</p>
        <p>Some things, like strawberry lemonade Italian ice ($1.50 for a small, presented in a paper cup the proper way, with no spoon), sound good -- and they are -- without any explanation at all. But Mr. Elefante, who produces eight Italian ice flavors daily in addition to his ice creams, has a way of making even obvious flavors seem special. Mochaccino Italian ice, for example.</p>
        <p>''It's coffee and chocolate, and it's creamy, but it's not at all like ice cream,'' he said. Somehow, the sensation is colder, Mr. Elefante said. ''This is really, really cold. Incredibly cold. You've got to taste it.''</p>
        <p>Zita's Homemade Ice Cream, 1790 Springfield Avenue, New Providence, (908) 464-1511. Open Sunday to Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.</p>
