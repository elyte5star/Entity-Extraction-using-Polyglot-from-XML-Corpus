        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Whenever I read an editorial like ''New York's Powerful Ghosts'' (May 27) on the need to curb out-of-control public authorities in New York, I chuckle. While some reforms are needed, like prohibiting employees of the appointers from serving on the boards, legislators calling for reform is like the line in ''Casablanca'' where the police inspector professes shock that there is gambling going on.</p>
        <p>New York's public authorities are creatures of the state. The governor generally appoints the board members. Sometimes the legislative leaders get to appoint board members. Board members must generally be confirmed by the State Senate. The state and city comptrollers have the authority to audit public authorities. Bond sales by large public authorities must be approved by a board composed of representatives of the governor and the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer cannot be blamed for the appointments of his predecessor, but the Legislature has no one to blame but itself if it believes that public authorities are out of control.</p>
