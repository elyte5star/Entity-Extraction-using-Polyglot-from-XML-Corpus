        <p>THOMAS--Jeffrey Furlough, died in San Francisco on June 2, 2007 in the presence of his immediate family. Born in New York City on November 27, 1938 he was the beloved husband of Evelyne Champin, to whom he was married 38 years ago; the adored father of Patrick (and father-inlaw of Rachel) and Fiona Thomas; the cherished brother of Michael M. Thomas, Joan Chatfield-Taylor and the late Robert F. ChatfieldTaylor Jr.; the cynosure of a loving gaggle of nieces and nephews-and we will all miss desperately the pleasure of his company; his wit, erudition, passion for the good things of body and spirit and his generosity. A graduate of Brooks School (1956) and Yale (1960), with a doctorate in American letters from UC Berkeley, he became an antiquarian book seller of great distinction and an admired figure in the trade; as one of his colleagues observed in a remembrance: ''Jeffrey was a wonderful fellow full of good will and knowledge-the latter which he carried lightly.'' (Citizens of the book world and others having recollections of Jeffrey they'd like to share with the family are invited to send them to: pjthomas66@gmail.com). A service of thanksgiving for Jeffrey's life will be held in San Francisco Thursday June 14, 2007 at the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park at 5:30pm.</p>
