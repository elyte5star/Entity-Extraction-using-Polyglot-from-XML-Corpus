        <p>ARNDT--Bess R. Died peacefully on June 9th, in her 96th year. Beloved mother of Carol Wolfe of NYC, beloved grandmother of Jessica Lynn Wolfe of Durham, NC, loving mother-in-law of Steven W. Wolfe, loving grandmotherin-law of Reid Barbour and sister of the late Alan Zuker. She was happily married to Arthur A. Arndt for over 43 years, until he passed away 23 years ago. She and her family arrived in the United States in 1914 from Russia and she grew up in Cleveland, OH. She came to Manhattan at age 18 to attend art school. With the arrival of the Depression the next year, she had to leave school and go to work in the fashion field. Many years later, she became an interior designer. After her retirement, she volunteered at the Whitney Museum and at the Brandeis Thrift Shop. She had a long, wonderful life. Funeral services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, West 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. on Monday, June 11th, at 1pm. The family will be at home Monday evening between 7:30 and 9:30pm. No flowers please.</p>
