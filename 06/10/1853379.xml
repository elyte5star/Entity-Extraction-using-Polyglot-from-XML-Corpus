        <p>Coyote attacks in Middletown have prompted the State Department of Environmental Protection, working with wildlife experts at the United States Department of Agriculture, to equip teams with night-vision equipment to track and kill the animals.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately there is no way to move the pack, so they're going to have to be sacrificed,'' said Lisa P. Jackson, the state environmental commissioner.</p>
        <p>The state believes the coyotes in Middletown are a ''particularly bold'' family pack that has lost its fear of humans, Ms. Jackson said. ''I think we might be able to keep this a relatively isolated incident,'' she said.</p>
        <p>State officials estimate that there are 3,000 coyotes in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In April, a coyote attacked a 20-month-old boy, and a 5-year-old boy was bitten by a coyote in May, said Eugene P. Hannafey, the deputy chief of police in Middletown. Both victims have recovered, he said.</p>
        <p>Middletown requested assistance from the Department of Environmental Protection after the first attack because employees of the township are not trained to handle wildlife, he said.</p>
        <p>Both attacks occurred near the Naval Weapons Station Earle, a sprawling base with sections in Colts Neck and Middletown that are connected by a 15-mile military road.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hannafey said that the city set 30 traps near the base after the first attack but had not caught any coyotes. An officer shot and killed a coyote the same week as the second attack, but there was no way of determining if it had attacked either child, he said.</p>
        <p>Pat Fisher, a spokesman for the Naval Weapons Station, said that no coyotes had been sighted on the base and that a Navy natural resources team did not find any evidence of coyotes.</p>
