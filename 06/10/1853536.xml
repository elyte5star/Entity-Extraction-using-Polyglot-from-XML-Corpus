        <p>Editorial holds only honorable choice Connecticut State Sen Louis DeLuca has is to resign; notes DeLuca received fine and suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to threaten his granddaughter's husband and promising to help business interests of James Galante, Danbury trash hauler suspected of mob ties</p>

        <p>The behavior of Connecticut officeholders has reached new lows in the last several years, with officials arrested on charges ranging from corruption to child molesting. Add to that sorry track record the recent arrest and guilty plea of State Senator Louis DeLuca, a Republican and the Senate minority leader.</p>
        <p>A deal allowed Mr. DeLuca to plead guilty last Monday to one count of conspiracy to threaten, and receive a fine and a suspended sentence. But his actions are far more disturbing than his misdemeanor conviction implies. In an act that sounds right out of ''The Sopranos,'' Senator DeLuca in 2005 asked James Galante, a Danbury trash hauler suspected of mob ties, to ''pay a visit'' to the husband of Mr. DeLuca's granddaughter, who the senator said was abusing her. Mr. Galante told two associates to assault the man, but law enforcement agents wiretapping him were able to intervene.</p>

        <p>The behavior of Connecticut officeholders has reached new lows in the last several years, with officials arrested on charges ranging from corruption to child molesting. Add to that sorry track record the recent arrest and guilty plea of State Senator Louis DeLuca, a Republican and the Senate minority leader.</p>
        <p>A deal allowed Mr. DeLuca to plead guilty last Monday to one count of conspiracy to threaten, and receive a fine and a suspended sentence. But his actions are far more disturbing than his misdemeanor conviction implies. In an act that sounds right out of ''The Sopranos,'' Senator DeLuca in 2005 asked James Galante, a Danbury trash hauler suspected of mob ties, to ''pay a visit'' to the husband of Mr. DeLuca's granddaughter, who the senator said was abusing her. Mr. Galante told two associates to assault the man, but law enforcement agents wiretapping him were able to intervene.</p>
        <p>Just as serious is Mr. DeLuca's promise last year, to an F.B.I. agent posing as an employee of Mr. Galante, to do anything in his power in the state legislature to help Mr. Galante's business interests. His pledge came three months after Mr. Galante was indicted on 117 counts of racketeering.</p>
        <p>The many lawmakers who have minimized and rationalized Mr. DeLuca's unacceptable actions are out of touch with citizen disgust at the everyday corruption that infects our state. Several legislators have even criticized the few who have called for Mr. DeLuca's ouster. But that's the only honorable choice. Mr. DeLuca must resign.</p>
