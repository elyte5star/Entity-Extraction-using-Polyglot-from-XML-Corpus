        <p>HAKES--Martha Jean. March 6, 1930-May 24, 2007. Jean Hakes lived and worked in New York from 1964 to 1989. She died peacefully on Thursday, May 24, 2007 at her home in San Francisco at the age of 77. Ms. Hakes, born in Muscatine, Iowa, was the dear daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Crampton Hakes; loving mother of Barbara; grandmother of Benjamin; beloved sister of Mary Anne Gallagher and the late Elizabeth H. Harrer. She was dearly loved by many other family members. Jean had many friends and colleagues on the East Coast who made her life joyful personally and professionally for over 25 years. Jean Hakes, a soprano, was extremely active throughout her career in performances of early and Baroque music. She was a soloist and toured with the New York Pro Musica under Noah Greenberg and appeared with numerous chamber groups such as the New York Baroque Ensemble, the Renaissance Quartet, the Trio Flauto Dolce and the Washington Consort, in addition to her numerous solo appearances including performances at Yale University, the University of California at Berkeley and New York University. She sang the role of ''Galatea'' in the New York Chamber Soloists presentation of Handel's Acis and Galatea in major concert series throughout the United States. She was professor of music at Brooklyn College where she also directed a Collegium Musicum. ''Few are the singers who can spin out a phrase as she does, with an equal mixture of emotional suspense, rhythmic flair and stunning dynamic control,'' commented the Washington Post of her performances. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to: Conservatory of Music Brooklyn College -The City University of New York 2900 Bedford Avenue Brooklyn, New York 11210. Phone: (718) 951-5286.
