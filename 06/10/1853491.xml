        <p>Bonde do Role</p>
        <p>Simple riffs and the minimal technology of the early 1980s are all that the lighthearted Brazilians in Bonde do Role need on their album ''With Lasers'' (Domino). Sparse samples and beats from cheap drum machines back up completely irrepressible male and female rapper-singers who make declarations like ''We're just like Jesus, we just love everybody/Especially if it's a hottie.'' Their ''Gasolina'' (not the Daddy Yankee song), with deadpan women's voices turning ''Afrika Bambaataa'' into a percussive hook, ought to have dance floors everywhere chanting, ''Boom-cha-cha, chicky chicky cha.''</p>
        <p>The Teeth</p>
        <p>The Teeth's first full-length album, ''You're My Lover Now'' (Park the Van), is a population explosion. Songs fling shards of narrative about dozens of characters: lovers, friends, schoolkids, parents, depressives, liars, strivers, even partygoers tootling kazoos. The bits of stories arrive in an even more manic outpouring of tunes: honky-tonk, garage-rock, music-hall Merseybeat, frantic new wave and a final tinkly philosophical ballad with an apt self-diagnosis: ''You got too many ideas building up inside of you.'' It's an overload, but an exhilarating one; these songs are worth decompressing.</p>
        <p>The Dynamites Featuring Charles Walker</p>
        <p>New York City has the Dap-Kings, the retro funk and soul band that recently backed Amy Winehouse. Nashville has the Dynamites, whose approach is about three-quarters James Brown -- especially mid-1960s James Brown -- with touches of Memphis, Motown and New Orleans. For its album ''Kaboom!'' (Outta Sight), the band's guitarist and leader, Bill Elder, a k a Leo Black, has written strong, vintage-style songs, whether he's tackling social issues (''Way Down South'') or immediate pleasures (''Can You Feel It?'') and arrangements that mesh a bustling rhythm section with meaty horns. The Dynamites have found a singer to put them across: Charles Walker, who has been on the soul circuit since the 1960s. His voice rivals better-known headliners; he's an authoritative, gospel-steeped shouter and a dramatic ballad builder. It's old-school music that works up a genuine sweat.</p>
        <p>Nick Drake</p>
        <p>So many songwriters are now routinely compared to Nick Drake that it's good to revisit his own music: his elegant guitar picking, his melancholy imagery and his hushed, smoky, mournfully resigned voice. ''Family Tree'' (Bryter Music) is for fanatics. It's a newly unearthed collection of home recordings, made before his 1969 debut album. ''Family Tree'' shows his style coalescing from family singalongs, the dark narratives of traditional British songs, folky American blues and, from the beginning, his own thoughts of estrangement and isolation, notably ''They're Leaving Me Behind,'' which can be heard at brytermusic.com. ''Success can be gained but at too great a cost/For some there's a future to find,'' he quietly sang. He died in 1974, at 25, from an overdose of antidepressants.</p>
        <p>Alex Delivery</p>
        <p>Every so often on Alex Delivery's debut album, ''Star Destroyer'' (Jagjaguwar), a diffident male or female voice offers a few songwriterly stanzas. But the semblances of songs are virtually mirages within tracks that ripple into vertiginous sonic reveries: pulsating layers of harmony, stray creaks and buzzes, string orchestras, explosions to the beat or whimsical la-las, all unfurling in an oddly coherent dream logic. ''She finds beauty in strange places,'' one song offers; so does the band.</p>
        <p>Bruce Springsteen</p>
        <p>Bruce Springsteen's 17-member Sessions Band was an improbable combo, representing a compendium of American traditions, making it thoroughly untraditional. It had brass for New Orleans jazz, a bluegrass string band, gospel and soul keyboards, Celtic pennywhistle and more, and it played old, upbeat songs of resistance and Mr. Springsteen's own tales of private dilemmas. The lineup let Mr. Springsteen ground songs anywhere he chose. By the time the group's tour ended with the concerts recorded and videotaped for ''Live in Dublin'' (Columbia), he had turned ''If I Should Fall Behind'' into an Irish waltz, ''Atlantic City'' into an old-timey mountain tune and ''Growin' Up'' into country. Historical roots were immaterial; it was about hot-wiring the legacy.</p>
