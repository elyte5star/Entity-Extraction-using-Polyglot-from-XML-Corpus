        <p>A judge ordered the death penalty last week for the man convicted of the 2005 killing of Lindsey M. Bonistall, a college student from White Plains.</p>
        <p>The man, James E. Cooke Jr., was convicted on March 8 in New Castle County Court in Wilmington, Del., in the murder of Ms. Bonistall, a 20-year-old sophomore at the University of Delaware.</p>
        <p>Citing the victim's ''slow, painful, terrifying death,'' Judge Jerome O. Herlihy said he would follow the jury's recommendation of death by lethal injection for Mr. Cooke. Ms. Bonistall was raped and strangled in her off-campus apartment in Newark, Del., on May 1, 2005.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Mr. Cooke, 36, a former convict from New Jersey who was arrested six weeks later, set fire to Ms. Bonistall's apartment in an apparent attempt to cover up his crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooke's lawyers had not challenged the prosecution's evidence. Instead, they argued that the defendant had been mentally ill as a result of severe neglect in childhood.</p>
        <p>In his decision, Judge Herlihy acknowledged the circumstances of Mr. Cooke's upbringing, but described the murder of Ms. Bonistall as ''especially cruel.''</p>
        <p>He noted that Ms. Bonistall was a stranger to Mr. Cooke and called his claims that he had consensual sex with her ''absurd.'' The judge reviewed the particularly violent nature of the crime and described Mr. Cooke as ''a very dangerous person.''</p>
        <p>''Strangling Bonistall requires a desire to kill lasting much longer than pulling a trigger one or two times,'' Judge Herlihy said in his decision. ''It is particularly 'up close and personal.' The use of her T-shirt and pressing on her chest betrays a cold-blooded viciousness.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bonistall was a 2003 graduate of Good Counsel High School in White Plains. A bench in front of the school will be dedicated in her honor on June 10 at 2:30 p.m. At the ceremony, the establishment of a scholarship fund in her name will also be announced.</p>
        <p>The Bonistalls have already established a foundation in her name to improve security at off-campus housing at universities around the country.</p>
