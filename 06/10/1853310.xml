        <p>Joseph P. Nacchio, the former Qwest chief executive convicted in April on 19 counts of insider trading, is hoping that a change of scenery can spare him from the slammer. Mr. Nacchio is set to be sentenced the end of next month, but his lawyers petitioned a federal judge in Denver last week to overturn his conviction and move the case outside the city for a retrial.</p>
        <p>The odds against Mr. Nacchio seem long. The same judge denied similar requests twice before, saying he was confident that jurors were capable of a fair evaluation, even though many of them acknowledged having heard of the case. Qwest is based in Denver.</p>

        <p>The request for a retrial last Monday began a busy week for Mr. Nacchio's lawyers. On Tuesday, they formally answered another legal challenge: a civil complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging many of the same actions Mr. Nacchio was convicted of in criminal court. Mr. Nacchio denies the allegations.</p>
