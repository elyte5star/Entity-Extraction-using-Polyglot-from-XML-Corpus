        <p>ON a recent Sunday afternoon in Park Slope, no one could blame Drew Hoffman, a graduate student who is moving to Montreal, for first trying to unload a few relics at a stoop sale. Surely, though, he'd made a mistake. Amid the wreckage of artifacts -- a stone-age printer, old course books from Hunter College, a threadbare Dead Kennedys T-shirt from high school -- were boxes and boxes of CDs. They were good ones, too, like ''Southpaw Grammar'' by Morrissey, the former lead singer of the Smiths, and ''Chutes Too Narrow'' by the Shins.</p>
        <p>''I have two iPods,'' said Mr. Hoffman, a scruffily bearded 26-year-old who wore a nose stud and yellow-tinted sunglasses. ''I haven't really bought CDs in a while.''</p>

        <p>ON a recent Sunday afternoon in Park Slope, no one could blame Drew Hoffman, a graduate student who is moving to Montreal, for first trying to unload a few relics at a stoop sale. Surely, though, he'd made a mistake. Amid the wreckage of artifacts -- a stone-age printer, old course books from Hunter College, a threadbare Dead Kennedys T-shirt from high school -- were boxes and boxes of CDs. They were good ones, too, like ''Southpaw Grammar'' by Morrissey, the former lead singer of the Smiths, and ''Chutes Too Narrow'' by the Shins.</p>
        <p>''I have two iPods,'' said Mr. Hoffman, a scruffily bearded 26-year-old who wore a nose stud and yellow-tinted sunglasses. ''I haven't really bought CDs in a while.''</p>
        <p>As the weather warms and New Yorkers wrap up their spring cleaning, more and more CDs are going the way of the cassette and the eight-track tape. While some iPod owners are selling their albums to iPod-challenged friends and neighbors, others are simply dumping entire collections on the sidewalk. Either way, it's almost impossible to walk down the street without tripping over the city's aural histories. Call it CD roadkill.</p>
        <p>On Fifth Avenue a few days ago, Jeff Dup√©e, the lanky redheaded bassist in the pop-punk band the Impulse, spotted two clear trash bags filled with indie-rock CDs.</p>
        <p>''I've thought about taking them to sell at the CD store that's two blocks away,'' he said the other day, presiding over his own stoop sale on Third Street near Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The adage that one man's trash is another's treasure still holds true for many music lovers. David Graham, a graying sales clerk at the Borders bookstore on Wall Street, regularly scavenges Park Slope for jilted discs. At Mr. Hoffman's stoop sale, he unearthed a gem.</p>
        <p>''I've been looking for this for a long time,'' Mr. Graham confided triumphantly as he hunched over the jewel case for ''Tom's Album,'' which contained an anthology of versions of the Suzanne Vega song ''Tom's Diner'' and liner notes. ''You know the song: 'Do-to-do-do, do-to-do-do.' '' He went on to purchase three discs for $8. ''I'm old-fashioned,'' he said. ''I like something to hold onto.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Graham and other collectors, the object of their affection is just that: the tactile object. ''Anything I really love I'm never going to get rid of because it's the packaging and everything -- the physicality of having it,'' said Megan Gerrity, a 32-year-old writer wearing black cat-eyed glasses and Converse sneakers. She recently parted with much of her ska-punk collection from high school, including Skankaholics Unanimous and Spawn of Skarmageddon compilations.</p>
        <p>At the very least, added Michael Rabbitt, a 28-year-old software developer, keeping those CDs provides a little insurance. ''I have to deal with picking up the pieces when computers fail,'' he said, ''so I'm a little paranoid about having backups.''</p>
