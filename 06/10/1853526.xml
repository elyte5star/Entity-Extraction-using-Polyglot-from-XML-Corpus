        <p>Perhaps Lawrence Kramer should get out more. Well-placed display cases, video monitors? For the New York Philharmonic there are several of those at Avery Fisher Hall. Different possibilities of performance? Michael Tilson Thomas did just that at Carnegie Hall on Feb. 28, presenting the Fifth Symphony of Shostakovich, first with altered notes, then as the composer intended. A gift shop in which to linger? The Barbican in London is virtually a shopping mall.</p>

        <p>Listening to Mahler ''the way you would look at Klimt'' can be a worthy goal, but it's up to the listener -- the museumgoer -- to learn beforehand about Mahler and Klimt, and about listening and seeing and making connections. I see the stumbling block as an inherited European tradition that still bristles at American brashness.</p>
