        <p>IT is an open secret in New York that some co-op boards have adopted what are known as ''floor prices'' -- minimum sales prices for apartments in their buildings.</p>
        <p>Whether the practice is appropriate, or even legal, is open to question.</p>
        <p>''We just received a call from a desperate shareholder in a building that has a minimum sale price for all apartments in the building based on their size,'' said Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rothman said that while the caller did not identify the co-op, there are a number of co-ops, most of them outside Manhattan, that have adopted similar ''floor price'' policies to prevent sales below market prices, which could affect the value of other apartments in the building.</p>
        <p>But can, or should, a co-op do this?</p>
        <p>''I think it is plainly illegal,'' said Irving Sonnenschein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonnenschein said that a co-op board's job is to protect the interests of the co-op corporation, not individual shareholders.</p>
        <p>He said that while the sale price of an apartment in the building directly relates to the value of the shares assigned to that apartment -- the higher the sale price, the higher the per-share value -- and that while the sale price of one apartment could affect the per-share value of other apartments, the co-op board has no authority to control sale prices.</p>
        <p>''It is understandable that shareholders want to keep the value of their shares as high as possible,'' Mr. Sonnenschein said. ''But the business of a corporation does not include trying to maintain the value of its shares.'' He contends that doing so is ''basically a form of stock manipulation.''</p>
        <p>Aaron Shmulewitz, another Manhattan co-op lawyer, disagreed. ''I don't see why co-op boards should not be doing this,'' he said. ''Board members have a fiduciary duty to protect the financial interests of the corporation and all its shareholders. And allowing sales for below-market value would damage the financial interest of the co-op and its shareholders.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shmulewitz said at least two court cases had addressed the issue. In one, State Supreme Court in White Plains ruled in 1995 that a co-op board did not have the right to set minimum sale prices. But in the second case, in 1999, Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled the other way. These are both lower court cases that are not binding on other courts, Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
        <p>Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is a vice president of the co-op and condo council, said that while he believes boards have the power to impose floor prices, this power should generally not be exercised.</p>
        <p>''The co-op board should not be trying to second-guess the marketplace,'' he said. ''And the marketplace determines what the value of an apartment is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein said that in a building where there is a flip tax based on the gross sale price -- that is, a percentage of the sale price that must be paid to the co-op -- and the board believes that the sale price is being deliberately understated to reduce the flip tax, it can decline to approve the sale.</p>
        <p>Other than that, Mr. Weinstein said, a board should not be involved in price matters. ''They could be badly hurting the seller,'' he said. ''And this is especially true in a declining market because the seller will not be able to get today's price tomorrow, and that will only exacerbate the problem.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Weinstein said, if a co-op is convinced that an apartment is so underpriced as to warrant board intervention, the co-op should buy the apartment itself and resell it.</p>
        <p>''I've represented several co-ops that have done that,'' he said. ''That eliminates the injury to the seller because the seller is getting his price, and the co-op could make a profit if the board's judgment is correct.''</p>
