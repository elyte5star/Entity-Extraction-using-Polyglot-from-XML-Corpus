        <p>Editorial calls on school board in Fort Lee, NJ, not to renew contract of superintendent Joanne Calabro, who lifted speech to high school's National Honor Society almost verbatim from Web site, without attribution</p>

        <p>With all the stories about students getting into trouble for plagiarism, it is hard to believe that the head of a public school system would commit the same kind of ethical lapse. But Joanne Calabro, the school superintendent in the northern New Jersey town of Fort Lee, has done exactly that.</p>
        <p>Ms. Calabro last month delivered a speech to her high school's National Honor Society that contained all the appropriate encomiums to honesty and scholarship. And it might have been a nice little speech were it not for one fact. She had lifted it almost verbatim from a Web site, without attribution.</p>

        <p>With all the stories about students getting into trouble for plagiarism, it is hard to believe that the head of a public school system would commit the same kind of ethical lapse. But Joanne Calabro, the school superintendent in the northern New Jersey town of Fort Lee, has done exactly that.</p>
        <p>Ms. Calabro last month delivered a speech to her high school's National Honor Society that contained all the appropriate encomiums to honesty and scholarship. And it might have been a nice little speech were it not for one fact. She had lifted it almost verbatim from a Web site, without attribution.</p>
        <p>Ironically, the Web site speech itself contained an implied warning that Ms. Calabro could be on dangerous ground. ''If there is any one thing that is evidenced by your daily choices it is your character,'' stated the 6-minute talk posted on About.com, an information site owned by The New York Times Company, as an example of what a speaker might say to a student audience.</p>
        <p>Ms. Calabro has since apologized to the students and said it never dawned on her to credit the Web site. She also said she did nothing illegal.</p>
        <p>Still, one would expect a school superintendent to hold herself to a higher standard than simply obeying the law. And while she undoubtedly has many, many important things to do, one would also expect her to take the trouble to write her own stuff.</p>
        <p>Later this month, Fort Lee's school board will decide whether it will renew Ms. Calabro's contract for another three years. It would be amazing if they agreed to do so.</p>
