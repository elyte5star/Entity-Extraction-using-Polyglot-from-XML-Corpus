        <p>Automobile executives argued in Washington last week against proposals to significantly increase gasoline mileage standards. But their companies already compete vigorously in Europe and China, where the standards are well above those in the United States.</p>
        <p>So why the opposition?</p>
        <p>The automakers say Americans won't pay the sticker price for the billions of dollars they would have to invest to upgrade plants and build new ones to produce smaller cars.</p>
        <p>They also say higher fuel standards would jeopardize the highly profitable market for pickups and sport utility vehicles, where they consistently beat foreign competitors.</p>
        <p>Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan, said the executives complained that the Senate bill would force them ''to build cars that haven't been selling well to a public that isn't interested in buying them.''</p>
        <p>The bill would raise the mileage requirement to 35 miles a gallon by 2020, up from 27.5 miles a gallon now.</p>
        <p>Some critics say American automakers are hurting themselves, noting consumers are lining up to pay the full sticker price -- and more -- for fuel-efficient vehicles like the hybrid-electric Toyota Prius and the small Honda Fit.</p>
        <p>Further delays by Detroit will put them farther behind foreign competitors, said Joan Claybrook, a consumer advocate and former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
        <p>The technology to make a more fuel-efficient car is no secret.</p>
        <p>Europe requires cars to get an average of 37.5 miles to the gallon. To compete there, Ford and General Motors sell a variety of small and mid-size cars and cross-over vehicles, some with diesel engines, which they don't sell in the United States. Ford and G.M. build those vehicles in overseas plants to meet European standards.</p>
        <p>But in Europe, where gasoline prices are higher, consumers are willing to pay about 25 percent more for a fuel-efficient car.</p>
        <p>Standards are also higher in China, both the world's second-biggest car market and G.M.'s second-biggest market. China's first fuel standard, 30.2 miles per gallon for the typical car, was imposed in 2005, and will be raised to 36 miles per gallon in 2008.</p>
        <p>After years of resistance, automakers agree an increase in fuel standards is inevitable. But they want to go slow. ''We want to get to a reasonable number that is doable,'' said Alan R. Mullaly, Ford's chief executive.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 17, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday on the resistance of American automakers to proposals that would significantly increase gasoline mileage misspelled the name of the chief executive of the Ford Motor company. He is Alan R. Mulally, not Mullaly.</p>
