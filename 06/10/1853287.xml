        <p>''THE Sopranos'' ends this weekend after seven seasons. The ''Harry Potter'' series ends in a few weeks with the publication of the seventh book, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.'' Serious assessments are beginning to appear -- see the current Newsweek -- comparing the two wildly popular phenomena. Wisecracks are turning up on blogs and in comedy routines: Tony Soprano will be whacked in the final Potter book, and so on. But all that really needs to be said is contained in this comparative analysis.</p>
        <p>NEIL GENZLINGER</p>
        <p>Harry Potter, sorcerer-hero</p>
        <p>Where we last left them: Saving the world from Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters</p>
        <p>Why they're special: Survived attack by Voldemort as baby; thunderbolt scar on his forehead to prove it</p>
        <p>Psychological issues: Talks to snakes</p>
        <p>What they would love to catch: The golden snitch</p>
        <p>Tony Soprano, carting executive-thug</p>
        <p>Where we last left them: Saving himself from Phil Leotardo, Brooklyn boss</p>
        <p>Why they're special: Survived his mother's wish to kill him; psychiatry bills to prove it</p>
        <p>Psychological issues: Attracted to his shrink</p>
        <p>What they would love to catch: A dirty snitch</p>
        <p>Dialogue from ''Harry Potter'' that could be in ''The Sopranos''</p>
        <p>''This is devil's snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster.''  ''Your dad would have spared me. He would have shown me mercy.''  ''Fasten your safety belts, clench your buttocks. It's going be a bumpy ride.''</p>
        <p>Dialogue from ''The Sopranos'' that could be in ''Harry Potter''</p>
        <p>''My family was different from other kids' families.''  ''Does the end of the world concern you?''  ''Gassed? My father told me they took him to a farm.''  ''You sit on an egg for months, one little thing goes wrong, and you're left with nothing.''</p>
        <p>Imagined dialogue from ''The Sopranos'' that could be in ''Harry Potter''</p>
        <p>''Get us a bludger and a couple beaters. We're gonna muggle that ungrateful jerk.''</p>
        <p>Imagined dialogue from ''Harry Potter'' that could be in ''The Sopranos''</p>
        <p>''The point of the game is to throw the jamook through the goomah before the other team's mortadellas catch you.''</p>
        <p>''Harry Potter'' characters who sound as if they belong in ''The Sopranos''</p>
        <p>Nearly Headless Nick  The Weasleys  Crookshanks</p>
