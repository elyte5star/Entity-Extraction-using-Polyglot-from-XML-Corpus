      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In an area with a pronounced French and French-speaking population, two noteworthy Larchmont stores, just a scant block apart, offer easy shopping for the magical pairing of cheese and wine, welcome at any time but particularly suited to a summer pique-nique.</p>
        <p>Matthew Peretz, proprietor of Auray Cheese Shop, is clearly serious about the quality of the cheeses he carries, careful to sell them at the perfect point of ripeness. Even as we entered Auray, Mr. Peretz was refusing a delivery that, he explained, would be unacceptable to his customers.</p>

        <p>In an area with a pronounced French and French-speaking population, two noteworthy Larchmont stores, just a scant block apart, offer easy shopping for the magical pairing of cheese and wine, welcome at any time but particularly suited to a summer pique-nique.</p>
        <p>Matthew Peretz, proprietor of Auray Cheese Shop, is clearly serious about the quality of the cheeses he carries, careful to sell them at the perfect point of ripeness. Even as we entered Auray, Mr. Peretz was refusing a delivery that, he explained, would be unacceptable to his customers.</p>
        <p>Whether the milk is from cow, goat or sheep, the resulting cheeses soft or hard, his selection is broad and international -- with France well represented -- and includes a few local and artisanal products as well. About 150 varieties pass through his shop every year; of these, just 100 may be ready at any one time. Careful to ensure a fresh and seasonal supply, Mr. Peretz stocks only a limited quantity of each. Add a few slices of salami or ham or a thick tranche of pâté; a baguette; mustard, quince or fig preserves and a handful of cornichons or olives. All are available here and take you more than halfway to a repast en plein air.</p>
        <p>One block south, Le Wine Shop occupies new roomy quarters with wines organized and identified in a way that could not be more user-friendly. Of more than 600 labels, at least 60 percent are French. And Alexandre Bureiller, one of the shop's partners, is delighted to make suggestions -- a riesling, a light red or a few half-bottles for a tasting? -- to match both cheese and wallet.</p>
        <p>Now simply unpack on a grassy spot or on a rough-hewn picnic table in the back yard. Santé!</p>
        <p>Auray Cheese Shop, 1935A Palmer Avenue, Larchmont, (914) 833-2274. Open Tuesday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>Le Wine Shop, 1945 Palmer Avenue, Larchmont, (914) 833-9666. Open Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
