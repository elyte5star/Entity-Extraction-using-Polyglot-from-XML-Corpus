        <p>Christian Román went to Barretto Point Park on the waterfront in Hunts Point for the first time last month when the weather turned warm.</p>
        <p>He was pleased by the lovely landscaping in the new five-acre park, which opened last October with an alluring swath of grass and a soft margin of sand along the East River. But although he liked what he saw, he did not like what he smelled.</p>
        <p>There was a foul odor in the air that he guessed was a consequence of the park's location, wedged between a private fertilizer plant and a public wastewater treatment facility.</p>
        <p>''When you enter, you don't really smell it,'' said Mr. Román, a 21-year-old senior at St. John's University who was born and raised in the South Bronx, where he still lives with his parents. ''It hits you when you go near the beach volleyball area. You're like, 'Whoa.' I had to cover my mouth with my shirt and walk a little faster.''</p>
        <p>Complaints about odors that emanate from industrial facilities in Hunts Point are longstanding, but the $7.2 million park has drawn fresh attention to the problem, especially now as summerlike humidity intensifies the smell.</p>
        <p>''We're glad the park is there,'' said Elena Conte, a coordinator at Sustainable South Bronx, an environmental organization. ''People are enjoying it whenever they can. But the unresolved odor issues are a deterrent.''</p>
        <p>Of mounting concern to some residents of the Bronx is a plan by the city's Department of Environmental Protection to retrofit the wastewater plant with two egg-shaped ''digesters'' to process sludge. They are to be built close to the park and rise 13 stories high. Neighbors fear the odor will worsen.</p>
        <p>''We don't want the city to depreciate their investment in the park by doing an upgrade that scares people away,'' Ms. Conte said.</p>
        <p>Anne Canty, a deputy commissioner of the environmental agency, said the digesters are part of a nearly $800 million rehabilitation that will not be completed until 2014, vastly improving the plant's operations.</p>
        <p>The digesters, she said, generally do not increase odors unless something is working improperly. In the brew of neighborhood smells, Ms. Canty said, ''We do not believe that these digesters are going to be major contributors.''</p>
        <p>Still, some advocates are lobbying for the city to consider building the new digesters on the plant's property but farther away from the park, perhaps on the site where the current digesters are located.</p>
        <p>Ms. Canty said that building the digesters elsewhere would be far more expensive and extend the construction schedule longer. She added that her agency is meeting with a committee of local officials and residents as the retrofitting plan chugs forward.</p>
        <p>''People are right to be concerned about facilities in their community,'' she said. ''We're not dismissive of them at all.''</p>
