        <p>The comments of Martin M. Fitzgerald, the principal of the Robert E.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The comments of Martin M. Fitzgerald, the principal of the Robert E. Bell Middle School in Chappaqua (''Two Mothers, a Camera and a Look at School Lunch,'' June 3), reflect the continued resistance of too many school leaders when it comes to children's health. His claim that the Chappaqua Central School District promotes health is contradicted by the fact that soda, candy, chips and many other poor nutritional choices are served and sold in Chappaqua's schools, even though parents have been advocating for healthier fare since March 2002.</p>
        <p>Contrast this with the Katonah-Lewisboro School District, which entirely revamped its school food service in just one year and has received kudos from stakeholders for their healthy, delicious menu.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzgerald referred to some Chappaqua residents as ''parents who can be frustrated by the pace of change.'' After five years of advocacy, two district-wide committees charged with improving school food that have barely scratched the surface, and the continued refusal of school leaders to educate themselves on children's nutritional needs, our frustration is understandable.</p>
