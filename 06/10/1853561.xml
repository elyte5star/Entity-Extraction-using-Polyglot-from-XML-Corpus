        <p>YVONNE POLLACK unpacks a box of materials and begins a private art lesson, pointing out the masterly use of dots to create patterns of light and dark in an ink drawing. She then moves on to the combination of collage and pastels in an innovative mixed-media work and the shimmering effect produced by layering paint in a favorite watercolor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pollack, who is a board member and past director of education at the Katonah Museum of Art, isn't showering praise on a Picasso or Renoir. Rather, she's talking about the works of some of Westchester's most talented children's book illustrators, who are featured in the exhibition ''Seeing Stories'' at the Arts Exchange in White Plains, which houses the Westchester Arts Council.</p>
        <p>''These artists have to combine their skills of drawing and painting with the written word,'' she said. ''When the two come together perfectly so that the image takes you further than the words, then it's magical. It becomes the book we all remember.''</p>
        <p>The Arts Council exhibition, which opened June 9, as well as several book-readings and family workshops at the Arts Exchange, are part of ''Open Books,'' a collaboration sponsored by Target Stores that celebrates the art of children's book illustration and the importance of reading through a series of exhibitions and related programming that will run through October 2007. The other participating institutions are the Hudson River Museum, Katonah Museum of Art, Westchester Library System and Jacob Burns Film Center.</p>
        <p>The Arts Council asked Ms. Pollack to curate the exhibition with Jerry Pinkney, an award-winning children's book illustrator who lives in Croton-on-Hudson. The two decided to focus on the process by which 22 local artists bring words to life through imagery. ''Everyone wants to know how illustrators begin and the whole progression of bringing a book alive,'' Ms. Pollack said.</p>
        <p>Finished works are featured alongside panels showing where the artists' ideas came from, so that visitors can see the animal photographs that Matthew Van Fleet used as models for his baby book ''Tails'' or the doodles done by Jim Jinkins, and his children, that were incorporated into his book ''Pinky Dinky Doo,'' or the shadowbox full of pen, pencil, ink and watercolor preliminary sketches for Peter Sís's ''Play, Mozart, Play!''</p>
        <p>''Every June the Arts Council mounts an exhibition of Westchester artists,'' said Janet Langsam, the council's executive director, ''so it was an easy fit to join the 'Open Books' collaboration by focusing on the very creative and sophisticated group of local children's book illustrators.''</p>
        <p>The Katonah Museum will take a broader approach, surveying the best American picture-book art of the last decade while exploring the theme of the changing image of the child.</p>
        <p>''Children Should Be Seen: The Image of the Child in American Picture-Book Art,'' which opens July 1, is a collaboration between the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst, Mass., which is celebrating its 5th anniversary, and the Katonah Museum, which is marking the 10th anniversary of its Learning Center, where several of the 85 artists featured have previously been highlighted in educational programming for children designed to complement museum exhibitions.</p>
        <p>''The exhibition is structured in a way that we see a child's world as it opens up from infancy onward, a concept borrowed from progressive education,'' said Leonard S. Marcus, one of the curators. Pictures range from Eric Carle's acrylic-paint and tissue-paper collage for ''From Head to Toe,'' a book about a youngster discovering his body, to Nina Crews's computer-manipulated photo collage of a boy shopping on an urban street corner in ''The Neighborhood Mother Goose.''</p>
        <p>Author readings and book signings, and a panel on ''How to Get Published in Children's Books,'' are part of the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The most tightly focused of the ''Open Books'' programs, and certainly one with the most star quality, begins on Saturday at the Hudson River Museum, where visitors can meet David Macaulay, a Rhode Island-based artist who will be lecturing and signing books during the opening-day celebration. Mr. Macaulay, a 2006 MacArthur ''Genius'' Fellow and one of the most beloved children's book creators, is the author and illustrator of ''The Way Things Work'' and other best sellers highlighted in the show, including ''Cathedral,'' ''Ship,'' ''Mosque,'' ''Rome Antics'' and ''Black and White.''</p>
        <p>''Building Books: The Art of David Macaulay,'' organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., explores the artist's uncanny ability to draw things from the inside out and ground up, from the mechanics of everyday objects like two-way switches and zippers to some of the world's most complicated architectural structures. ''He's not just showing you how it's done, he's trying to get you to feel some of his own sense of amazement,'' said Laura Vookles, chief curator of collections at the Hudson River Museum.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vookles pointed out that not only will visitors be able to see a finished work, like the marker and pencil-on-paper drawing of ''We Have Arrived in Sanlúcar'' from ''Ship,'' but they'll also be able to view Mr. Macauley's photographs and sketches and a caravel ship model that he built after visiting a shipyard -- all done as part of his research. ''What was fascinating to me was to find out how much original material he's saved in his own archives over the years related to his bookmaking process,'' Ms. Vookles said.</p>
        <p>To encourage children to see the books for themselves, the 38 member libraries of the Westchester Library System will begin their summer reading programs at the end of this month. Judith Rovenger, the youth services consultant for the Westchester Library System, said there will be ''special displays, story hours and supplementary materials that feature local children's book illustrators as well as some of the other illustrators highlighted in the exhibitions.''</p>
        <p>The Jacob Burns Film Center is also participating in the ''Open Books'' program by presenting a series of films adapted from children's books, including ''Sounder,'' ''The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit'' and ''Great Expectations.'' Anne Marie Santoro, an educator at the Burns Center, will lead a book chat on July 29 following ''The Wizard of Oz'' and on Aug. 19 after ''Stuart Little.''</p>
        <p>The participating organizations have formed a joint marketing program, which includes a brochure with a pass that allows free admission or a member discount at each of the other locations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Langsam noted that this marks the second time several Westchester cultural institutions have collaborated around a particular theme. In 2006, the focus was suburbia. ''This time around,'' she said, ''we have the opportunity to join together and say, 'Yes, children's book illustration is an art -- and a very imaginative one at that.' ''</p>
        <p>Where the Illustrators Are</p>
        <p>A list of award-winning authors and illustrators of children's books and a guide to those living in Westchester, including links to their home pages, can be found under ''Just for Kids'' on the site of the Westchester Library System (westchesterlibraries.org).
