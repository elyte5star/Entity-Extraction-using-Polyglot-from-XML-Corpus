        <p>At Kiss the Chef, a restored railroad-car diner in Mineola, the owners, Horacio Mazariegos and his wife, Lorraine, have turned a family business into something like a neighborhood block party.</p>
        <p>The couple worked for 10 years for a Manhattan corporate caterer, which is how they met; they were married in 1999. Early in their culinary courtship, ''Horacio was making hearts out of the cheese in my Cobb salad,'' Ms. Mazariegos said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Six months ago, ready to start their own business, they found a timeworn 1947 diner that needed plenty of T.L.C. ''We decided to turn this little rinky-dink place into a success,'' Ms. Mazariegos said. ''It needed a lot of elbow grease, but it was worth it.''</p>
        <p>Refreshed by a new stainless steel wall behind the service counter and booths covered in a mauve print, the diner has the nostalgic feel of a small-town gathering place and the menu of an upscale bistro. Generous portions are served on stylish square plates at reasonable prices.</p>
        <p>Breakfast options include Belgian waffles with applewood bacon ($5.25) and huevos rancheros ($4.25), with homemade tortillas. The lunch menu features a shredded barbecued chicken sandwich ($7.95), an excellent 8-ounce Angus burger ($5.95) and flaky chicken potpie ($5.95). The Cobb salad brims with fresh mesclun greens, grilled chicken and pepper Jack cheese and corn in a balsamic dressing ($5.95).</p>
        <p>Judges and lawyers from the Nassau County Courthouse down the road, doctors from neighboring Winthrop-University Hospital, and office and factory workers vie for seats at the half-dozen booths and 20 counter stools in this tiny, convivial space. The friendly buzz of conversation keeps the energy high and, although there is table service, servers are just as likely to yell across the counter to customers: ''Ready for dessert?'' House-made cheesecake is $2.25.</p>
        <p>Reservations are accepted. Takeout, delivery and corporate catering are available.</p>
        <p>Kiss the Chef, 106 East Second Street, Mineola; (516) 739-9600. Open Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., for breakfast and lunch. Closed weekends.</p>
