        <p>The United States' 2-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago Saturday afternoon was never in doubt and put the Americans through to the Gold Cup tournament's knockout stage. Still, it raised a nagging question in its aftermath: once they get a lead, why can't the Yanks effectively kill off a game?</p>
        <p>Just as in the 1-0 win over Guatemala on Thursday night, the Americans dominated the early minutes of Saturday's game at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Calif. And once Justin Mapp dashed into the clear on the left flank and set up Brian Ching for a tap-in goal in the 26th minute, it seemed as if the floodgates would open -- particularly against a T&amp;T side made up almost entirely of domestically based, second-choice players.</p>
        <p>But that is not what happened. Curiously, the American attack sputtered, and Trinidad and Tobago got back in the game -- just as Guatemala did on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Over the last 20 minutes of the first half, the Soca Warriors were at least as good as the Amerks. A couple of Trinbagonian shots just missed -- including a long, last-minute drive by the free kick specialist Silvio Spann, struck with the outside of his right foot, that sent U.S. goalie Kasey Keller the wrong way.</p>
        <p>The halftime break came just in time for the Americans, who started 10 different players from those who'd started Thursday. Landon Donovan came in at midfield for the second half, and his savvy was responsible for the second U.S. goal. He put himself in the clear eight minutes after the restart and took a breakaway pass from Brian Ching, then coolly set up Eddie Johnson for a gimme goal that made it 2-0.</p>
        <p>Again, the floodgates seemed poised to open -- but again they did not. The Americans were unable to build on their lead. They ran out winners by a fairly modest 2-0.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, one had to wonder what might have happened if T&amp;T's World Cup players from last season -- excluded from this year's squad because of a pay dispute with the national federation -- had played the Americans Saturday.</p>
        <p>In fairness, several first-half breakaways by the Yanks were nullified by incorrect offside calls. And the T&amp;T keeper, Jan Michael Williams, made three or four excellent saves that denied certain goals. At the other end, beyond a couple of moments at the end of the first half and at the end of the game, T&amp;T did nothing to threaten the American nets.</p>
        <p>So this was a game the United States was always going to win. But still, why the unimpressive scoreline? Are the Americans like some kind of Italy when they face humble Concacaf foes -- doing only enough to assure victory, nothing more? Or do their 1-0 and 2-0 results speak of a real shortcoming in terms of decisiveness?</p>
        <p>The Americans are almost certain to beat El Salvador, a team they've never lost to, in their final group-stage game. But after that, the difficult knockout matches loom -- and then they'll learn the answers to the questions raised by these first two games.</p>
        <p>U.S. Player Ratings</p>
        <p>5.5 Kasey Keller (GK, Borussia Moenchengladbach, GER): Untested through 89 minutes, though he was lucky when one long, tricky T&amp;T free kick that sent him the wrong way went just wide. Did make a nice save at the end, though.</p>
        <p>6 Jonathan Spector (LD, West Ham, ENG): What little he did was competent, but it would have been nice to see him be more involved.</p>
        <p>6 Michael Parkhurst (CD, New England): The perfect, easy game for a national team debut. A bit shaky at the start but was solid the few subsequent times he had to do anything.</p>
        <p>6 Jay DeMerit (CD, Watford, ENG): Was steady on those rare occasions he was called on.</p>
        <p>7.5 Frankie Simek (RD, Sheffield Wed. ENG): A tad plump in physique, but an ex-captain of the Arsenal reserves with plenty of nous. A terrific attacking presence from his spot on right defense.</p>
        <p>6.5 Benny Feilhaber (MF, Hamburger SV GER): Served up a couple of dangerous balls over the T&amp;T defense before being subbed out at halftime.</p>
        <p>7 Landon Donovan (MF, Los Angeles): Played the second half and brilliantly got free for a breakaway before calmly setting up Johnson for a goal. Was robbed by a great save late in the match as well.</p>
        <p>6.5 Steve Ralston (MF, New England): Especially effective in the first 25 minutes, when American mastery was absolute.</p>
        <p>6.5 Ricardo Clark (MF, Houston): Normally a defensive midfielder but made a number of imaginative passes to the front-runners.</p>
        <p>7 Justin Mapp (MF, Chicago): Created the first goal with a run and cross from the left. Was rampant on the left side and a constant threat all day long.</p>
        <p>7.5 Brian Ching (MF, Houston): Scored in the 26th, sprung Donovan with a long pass to set up the second goal, and was a dangerous and intrepid presence throughout. Subbed out in the 64th.</p>
        <p>5.5 Michael Bradley (MF, SC Heerenveen, NED): Didn't make much of an impression playing the last half hour or so.</p>
        <p>7 Eddie Johnson (AT, Kansas City): Scored the second U.S. goal and could have had a couple more, had he not been flagged down on at least three erroneous offside calls. Went out in the 72nd with a tweaked knee.</p>
        <p>6 Taylor Twellman (AT, New England): Came in for the last 20 minutes and had one good play, setting up Donovan for a shot bravely saved by T&amp;T keeper Williams.</p>
