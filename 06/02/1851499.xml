        <p>THE government said economic growth was slower in the first quarter than it had initially estimated. Chinese markets swooned, but American investors reached new heights. The World Bank has big money-raising needs for its new leader.</p>
        <p>GROWTH STALLS -- The Commerce Department halved its estimate of how much the economy grew in the first quarter, revealing that there was hardly any growth at all.</p>
        <p>Growth in gross domestic product, the measure of all goods and services produced in the United States, was initially put at 1.3 percent, in an April report. But when the government recalculated it -- taking into account a larger trade deficit and shrinking inventory stockpiles at American businesses -- the G.D.P. advanced by just 0.6 percent.</p>
        <p>That was the slowest pace since the end of 2002. (The numbers will be revised one more time this month.) Yesterday, the government reported that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent and that 157,000 jobs were created in May, nearly twice the number added in April.</p>
        <p>April's trade deficit figures, which come out Friday, should shed some light on whether trade will actually help the G.D.P in the second quarter, as many economists expect it will.</p>
