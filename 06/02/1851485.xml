        <p>The Bancrofts, owners of a communications empire, were never very good at communicating with one another.</p>
        <p>For weeks, the family, which controls Dow Jones &amp; Company, seemed stalled, unable to agree on Rupert Murdoch's takeover offer, or even on a reply to his letters.</p>
        <p>Then last week, a family member, Leslie Hill, began prodding relatives to consider at least meeting with Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, people close to the family and to Dow Jones's board say.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill may not have changed any minds with the round of calls she made last week, people close to the Bancrofts say, but she pushed the family to take a clear stance rather than let things continue to drift.</p>
        <p>On Friday, May 25, Michael Elefante, a family lawyer and Dow Jones board member, told M. Peter McPherson, the company's chairman, that the Bancrofts wanted to meet with the board. What he did not reveal was that privately, a new consensus had emerged: family members arrived at the board meeting Thursday carrying a draft of a statement, released that evening, saying that they had decided to meet with the News Corporation.</p>
        <p>The meeting will take place Monday at noon, according to people close to the board and the family, nearly all of whom were granted anonymity. Family members say that at least some of them have signed confidentiality agreements.</p>
        <p>The decision to meet with the News Corporation could be a pivotal moment in the history of a company that the family has controlled for more than a century. Family members are already discussing ways that in the event of a takeover an internal governing board might be created to protect the news pages of Dow Jones's centerpiece, The Wall Street Journal, from the influence of Mr. Murdoch, whose brand of journalism they disdain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch's offer played to a long-simmering generational divide within the Bancroft family between the elders who held most of the voting power and were opposed to a sale and their children's generation, some of whom viewed the company as an underperforming asset that needed some kind of shake-up.</p>
        <p>The dissension was quashed 20 years ago and again 10 years ago, but this time it could not be ignored, as even older members of the family had developed doubts.</p>
        <p>The shift from rejecting Mr. Murdoch's bid to agreeing to meet with him occurred not in a dramatic flourish, but in many small steps that accumulated over weeks. In a flurry of phone calls throughout May, family members shared their concerns, with some of the younger ones lobbying the eight members of the older generation who hold voting control over most of the family's stock.</p>
        <p>''There's been a series of conversations, mostly one to one, between parents and children, between siblings, between cousins,'' one family member said.</p>
        <p>During the same time, family members heard a consistent message from their bankers and from Dow Jones officials: On its own, Dow Jones had middling long-term prospects, at best, and had little chance of getting the stock price anywhere near the $60 Mr. Murdoch offered.</p>
        <p>''I think some minds were changed over the last month of consulting with their financial advisers,'' said James Ottaway, a former Dow Jones board member who talks with the Bancrofts, and whose own family controls 5 percent of the shareholder vote. He is reluctant to sell the company, and adamantly opposed to selling to Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>''They're concerned about the future of Dow Jones in a more competitive landscape,'' he said of the Bancrofts, especially after the Thomson Corporation's mid-May acquisition of the Reuters Group, a major competitor of Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
        <p>But even as the Bancrofts were preparing to issue the statement Thursday night that put the company into play, there was still confusion among family members about where they stood. At the Dow Jones board meeting, Christopher Bancroft, who had only hours earlier signed off on the plan, said that he did not realize that by agreeing to meet with the News Corporation and consider other options, it was effectively putting the company up for sale, according to people at the meeting.</p>
        <p>''All I said is that we'd meet with him,'' Mr. Bancroft told the room, these people said. He went on to request that the family retract the statement even before it was sent. But by that point, the statement had been leaked to the press and the family's view was already in the board's minutes, so the family went ahead.</p>
        <p>On news of the family's openness to selling, Dow Jones stock surged past Mr. Murdoch's $60-a-share offer. Shares rose $7.89 yesterday, to $61.20.</p>
        <p>For generations, the widely scattered family has been an anomaly among media barons. They neither ran the company nor put their stamp on its journalism, not even The Journal editorial page that has long been more conservative than the Bancrofts themselves.</p>
        <p>In early May, Mr. Murdoch wrote to the family, requesting a meeting, but received no answer until Thursday. Public statements and internal argument are not the habit of the Bancrofts, who have long shared an aversion to confrontation and publicity, a distaste for frank discussion of money, and the view that the family should not delve too deeply into running the company.</p>
        <p>''These are not people who raise their voices, and even when there's been a lot of feelings about poor management, real debate is not their style,'' said James H. Lowell II, a former investment adviser to the family. ''Historically, they've been very passive.''</p>
        <p>The family said on May 1 that members representing 52 percent of the Dow Jones shareholder vote opposed Mr. Murdoch's offer, out of 64 percent controlled by the Bancrofts. But that statement, Mr. Ottaway said, ''represented a rainbow of opinions, from 'absolutely not,' to 'probably not,' '' -- and it was silent on the views of those who represented the remaining 12 percent of the family's vote.</p>
        <p>In addition, many younger family members were not consulted in that initial poll -- in fact, some say they still do not know how the 52 percent figure was arrived at. In family discussions, they voiced their displeasure at what some of them saw as the latest manifestation of a long tradition of treating adults in the younger generation like children.</p>
        <p>The daylong May 23 family meeting at Mr. Elefante's office in Boston turned into an unusually frank and long airing of opposing views. Several members of the older generation who had said they did not want to sell -- especially not to Mr. Murdoch -- did not bother to attend, and no decisions were made and no statement issued, but the conclave made clear how many people were open to sale.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill, a retired airline pilot, was uniquely positioned to nudge things along. She is the only member of the younger generation to sit on the company's board, and she comes from the Cox/Hill branch of the family, which included most of the people who, over the years, have called for a new direction for Dow Jones.</p>
        <p>Two of her brothers protested 20 years ago that the company was badly managed, but their view was quashed so effectively in family meetings that some relatives said recently that they had never heard of their protests. In that branch of the family, members of the younger generation are in their 40's and 50's -- nearly as old as the older generation in other branches -- but have little of the income or stock ownership, a situation that has long been a source of tension.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bancroft, who said early on that he was solidly against a Murdoch takeover, has clearly softened his position. William C. Cox Jr., who also voiced opposition to a sale, and another cousin, Martha S. Robes, who was quoted by family members as saying she would not be in the same room with Mr. Murdoch, have not spoken out recently.</p>
        <p>Elisabeth Chelberg, the only member of the younger generation who has inherited a large share of Dow Jones stock, and her second cousin, William C. Cox III, spoke out a decade ago, criticizing Dow Jones management. In recent years, they have kept their views to themselves, but people close to the family say that Ms. Chelberg has been pleased with the transition from Peter R. Kann, the long-time chief executive, to Richard F. Zannino, who took that post last year.</p>
        <p>Family members say that at first Ms. Chelberg did not favor a sale, content to give Mr. Zannino more time to turn the company around, but that recently she has become more amenable to a takeover.</p>
        <p>People who have spoken with family members say that some of the elders would prefer News Corporation stock to cash, to avoid a major capital gains tax bill.</p>
        <p>But their main concern is the editorial independence of The Journal. Some still say they might accept a lower offer from another buyer, and Thursday's statement stated an openness to other suitors, though none have stepped forward and Dow Jones officials say they do not expect any.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch has offered to set up a board within the News Corporation to oversee The Journal, presenting this as a way to allay the Bancrofts' fears about his manipulating the news pages to suit his financial and political ends. But family members and allies like Mr. Ottaway say that would not be protection enough.</p>
        <p>People close to the family and the Dow Jones board yesterday suggested a possible alternative: A board appointed entirely by the Bancrofts would have the sole power to name the top editors of The Journal, who would, in turn, choose the newsroom people below them. The board members would also name their own replacements, while Mr. Murdoch would retain control of the newspaper's business operations.</p>
