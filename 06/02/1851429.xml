        <p>The son-in-law of President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, accused in his homeland of kidnapping two leading bankers and running a crime network, was arrested by the Vienna police yesterday, a day after proclaiming his innocence in an interview with an Austrian news weekly.</p>
        <p>The son-in-law, Rakhat Aliyev, 44, was detained yesterday afternoon in the Austrian capital, said Gerald Hesztera, a spokesman for the country's federal bureau of investigation, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>The weekly, Profil, said it had spoken to Mr. Aliyev, who was stripped of his status as the Kazakh ambassador to Vienna last week, at his villa in Vienna. In the interview, he repeated that ''my only crime is that I have expressed opinions that deviate slightly from those of the president,'' adding that his present difficulties began after he expressed hopes of running for president himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aliyev, who has been chief of the tax service and deputy head of the Kazakh secret police, said that stripping him of his ambassadorship and issuing an international arrest warrant were actions intended to warn other members of the Kazakh elite to toe the president's line or risk ruin.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, a group of leading businessmen in Kazakhstan issued a strong statement of support for Mr. Nazarbayev, who has been in power since 1989.</p>
        <p>Analysts see recent events as part of a struggle touched off by Mr. Nazarbayev's approval of recent constitutional amendments that would allow him to remain president for life. Mr. Aliyev argued in the interview that while a strong hand was needed to rule Kazakhstan immediately after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, now it was time for reform, a true division of legislative, executive and judicial power, and independent courts.</p>
        <p>''A younger, more open generation should come to power,'' he said. ''Otherwise, they all sit either in jail or abroad.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aliyev said his wife, Mr. Nazarbayev's daughter Dariga, his 7-year-old daughter, 22-year-old son and his family were all still in Kazakhstan ''as hostages, if you like.'' He and his 16-year-old son are in Vienna, he said, adding that he intended to try to stay in Austria and apply for citizenship.</p>
        <p>Martin Staudinger, the Profil journalist who conducted the interview, said the Aliyev villa was well protected by police officers at the time. Mr. Aliyev expressed gratitude to Austria for affording him protection, alleging that Kazakh agents had tried to kidnap him and fly him back to Kazakhstan.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether he could be released on bail while awaiting court decisions on whether he will be extradited.</p>
