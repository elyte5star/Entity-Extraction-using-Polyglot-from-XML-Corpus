        <p>THE government said economic growth was slower in the first quarter than it had initially estimated. Chinese markets swooned, but American investors reached new heights. The World Bank has big money-raising needs for its new leader.</p>
        <p>In a case of exquisitely bad timing, Advanced Medical Optics was forced to begin a worldwide recall on May 25 of its leading cleaning solution for soft contact lenses -- just one day after the company said that it was considering bidding for Bausch &amp; Lomb, a rival hobbled by its own worldwide lens cleaner recall last year.</p>
        <p>Advanced Medical's possible bid for Bausch was shoved to the back burner by an unexplained link between its Complete MoisturePlus solution and an outbreak of serious eye infections caused by a microbe called acanthamoeba.</p>
        <p>Advanced Medical's new priorities are managing the recall, figuring out what made MoisturePlus users especially vulnerable to acanthamoeba, and forecasting the recall's potential financial impact.</p>
        <p>The recall and the scientific scrutiny of the outbreak are expected to drag on for months. But the company has promised to give Wall Street a first attempt at a revised financial forecast this Tuesday.</p>
