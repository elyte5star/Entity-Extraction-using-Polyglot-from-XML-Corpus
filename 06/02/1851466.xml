        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Concerts Found Onstage While Everyone Else Takes a Break'' (Arts pages, May 30):</p>
        <p>This fascinating article resonated with me, as I have practiced intermission sociology.</p>
        <p>I attended the Metropolitan Opera and Glimmerglass Opera, enjoying myself and then taking intermission notes on people's conversations.</p>
        <p>I hypothesized that people would focus on the performances. But I found that during opera intermissions, people most frequently talked about work, in particular work discontent. Family and friends came in a distant second, and the operas third.</p>
        <p>For some comparative intermission research, I studied ice hockey games. The same pattern was discerned. And work was the thing.</p>
        <p>It is indeed interesting to see what can be found ''in unexpected nooks.''</p>
        <p>Bruce M. Zelkovitz  Topeka, Kan., May 30, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's a pity that Chris DeLaurenti, the Seattle-based ''sound artist'' and composer, wasn't around in the early 1960s to clandestinely tape the intermission sounds emanating from the old Metropolitan Opera pit.</p>
        <p>Preserved for posterity would be the anecdotal banter in French, German and Italian of musicians born in the 19th century; an incredible rendition of Paganini's ''God Save the Queen'' by my Italian stand-partner (on a violin presented to him by Benito Mussolini); the croaking of a contrabassoon reed, whittled by a former president of the Vienna Philharmonic; and my own youthful attempts to master a difficult passage of Strauss or Wagner.</p>

        <p>The writer is a violinist with the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
