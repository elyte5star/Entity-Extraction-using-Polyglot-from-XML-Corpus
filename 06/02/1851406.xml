        <p>ARE we heading for a recession?</p>
        <p>''The U.S. consumer has been on a 15-year run, the longest streak on record. Now, the world's biggest spender is showing signs of fatigue,'' Bloomberg Markets reports.</p>
        <p>Consumer spending was up just 3.2 percent last year and has slowed since 2004, the magazine noted, adding that this is troublesome as consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>''History shows that a slowdown in spending coupled with weakness in other parts of the economy can trigger a recession,'' Shobhana Chandra wrote. ''That's what happened in 2001.''</p>
        <p>ON THE OTHER HAND -- Slowing real estate sales coupled with the subprime mortgage mess are two of the reasons some people say a recession is nigh.</p>
        <p>Those people are wrong, Kiplinger's writes.</p>
        <p>The magazine notes that only 1 percent of home mortgages are in foreclosure, ''compared with a post-recession peak of 1.5 percent.''</p>
        <p>For another, the housing market accounts for just ''8 percent to 10 percent of all economic activity, and other parts of the nation's economic engine appear to be humming nicely.''</p>
        <p>REAL ESTATES -- The following is courtesy of Harper's:</p>
        <p>At least 17,000 copies of ''Flipping Homes for Dummies'' have been sold since its publication last year.</p>
        <p>''Percentage of C.E.O.'s of S.&amp; P. 500 companies whose homes are at least 10,000 square feet or sit on more than 10 acres: 13 percent.''</p>
        <p>The chances that last year a homeowner had negative equity in the property, that is, owed more than the home's value: 1 in 6.</p>
        <p>NO MONEY DOWN -- Citing figures provided by the National Association of Realtors, Home reports ''43 percent of first-time home buyers bought their house without a down payment in 2006.''</p>
        <p>IS INEQUALITY GOOD? -- The growing income disparity among Americans can be viewed as a good thing, two professors at the University of Chicago argue in The American.</p>
        <p>Gary S. Becker, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1992, and Kevin M. Murphy write that the rising inequality has ''accompanied a rise in the payoff to education and other skills.''</p>
        <p>In 1980, someone with a college degree earned 30 percent more than a high school graduate. Today, there is about a 70 percent difference, and ''the premium for having a graduate degree increased from roughly 50 percent in 1980 to well over 100 percent today,'' they write. ''The labor market is placing a greater emphasis on education, dispensing rapidly rising rewards to those who stay in school the longest.''</p>
        <p>That isn't surprising, they say, given the increasing demand for educated and skilled workers. And the payoff for that increased demand is clear.</p>
        <p>''Growth in the education level of the population has been a significant source of rising wages, productivity and living standards over the past century,'' they write, and should be viewed as a positive, even if it results in a growing gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
        <p>Writing like the economists that they are, the authors point out that higher rates of return on capital are a sign of greater productivity and ''that inference is fully applicable to human capital as well as to physical capital.''</p>
        <p>They conclude: ''We believe that the rise in returns on investment in human capital is beneficial and desirable'' and they add, in a not-so-veiled message to politicians, ''policies designed to deal with inequality must take account of its cause.''</p>
        <p>FINAL TAKE -- Summertime is coming, and for most of us the living won't be as easy as it could be.</p>
        <p>Money magazine notes that Americans average the fewest days off and leave the greatest percentage of their vacation time unused, compared with other nations.</p>
        <p>The average American gets 14 days of vacation but takes only 11. Germans use 25 of the 26 days they receive; the British use 21 of their 24 days off; and the French use all but 3 of their 36 days, the magazine writes, citing research done by Expedia.com.</p>
        <p>All this leads the magazine to conclude that America is ''land of the free, home of the Type A personality.''</p>
