        <p>THE government said economic growth was slower in the first quarter than it had initially estimated. Chinese markets swooned, but American investors reached new heights. The World Bank has big money-raising needs for its new leader.</p>
        <p>China's stock market plummeted Wednesday after Beijing imposed higher taxes on stock trading activity in an attempt to cool off a sizzling market. China's two major stock indexes fell sharply in a huge sell-off, and the Shanghai composite index was down 6.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The sharp fall did not sway American markets. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index closed Wednesday at a level last reached on March 24, 2000. It ended the week up 1.4 percent, closing yesterday at 1,536.34.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Nasdaq climbed 2.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.2 percent. Some angry Chinese investors, however, lashed out at the government for earlier saying there was no intention to raise the stamp duty tax and then promptly reversing course early Wednesday, after the raging bull market reached new highs on Monday and Tuesday. There were even reports that investors hacked into a government finance Web site and shut it down.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, however, the market recovered slightly, but it continued its slide yesterday, ending the week down 4.3 percent. Still, one thing is clear: there is no panic.</p>
