        <p>A patch of Texas property used as a base camp by the antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan since 2006 became a battleground itself yesterday when an organization that supports the United States' continued presence in Iraq announced plans to buy the five-acre plot.</p>
        <p>The group, Move America Forward, which has been bitterly critical of Ms. Sheehan and other antiwar advocates, said in a statement that it would use the land, which Ms. Sheehan put up for sale this week, near President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., to create a park and memorial to American troops. It calls the project ''Monument to America's Heroes.''</p>
        <p>''We are not going to use the land as an anti-Cindy Sheehan statement,'' said Robert Dixon, a spokesman for the group. ''We want to take this land used to undermine troops and turn it around.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Ms. Sheehan, who announced Monday that she would step down as the face of the antiwar movement, said yesterday that ''it would be a cold day in hell'' before she would sell the land to Move America Forward.</p>
        <p>''They have been very hurtful to Cindy and Camp Casey,'' said DeDe Miller, Ms. Sheehan's spokeswoman and sister, referring to the Texas property, which is named after Ms. Sheehan's son, Specialist Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, who was killed in Iraq on April 4, 2004, at age 24.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dixon said Move America Forward would not back down. He said supporters flooded the organization with e-mail urging its leaders to buy the land at any cost after Ms. Sheehan announced plans to sell it.</p>
        <p>''We will do whatever we have to do to get the land,'' said Mr. Dixon, adding that they have already retained a real estate broker.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sheehan bought the property in 2006 for $52,000 using insurance money from her son's death. Ms. Miller said Ms. Sheehan would ''never knowingly sell Camp Casey to Move America Forward.''</p>
