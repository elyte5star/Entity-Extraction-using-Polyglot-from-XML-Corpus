        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Trust and Betrayal,'' by Paul Krugman (column, May 28):</p>
        <p>There are more ways to betray the public trust than simply the basic ''Bush-style fear-mongering'' adopted by some leading presidential candidates. I suggest that a better way to secure our future is through asking questions, not expressing contempt.</p>
        <p>Here's the way it really ought to be:</p>
        <p>Voters should question each and every candidate position and statement. Just imagine when those who scare us with the ''terrorists will 'follow us home' '' story are forced to confront some follow-up questions: ''Exactly who will be coming, how can you actually know that, and if all this information is available, why doesn't someone act on it now?''</p>
        <p>Or how about: ''Our national intelligence service in its entirety could not determine whether Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and you expect me to believe this?''</p>
        <p>But every candidate and every stance must be scrutinized and questioned. And when someone tells us what we want to hear and campaigns with promises to end the war, pointed questions about timetables, strategies and outcomes are definitely in order.</p>
        <p>For those who would mislead, deceive and let the mothers of other people's children grieve, questions just might be the answer.</p>
        <p>Tyler Kokjohn  Glendale, Ariz., May 28, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a conservative who generally votes Republican, I never thought that I'd agree with Paul Krugman. But his Memorial Day column, about the delusional rationale for this misbegotten war, is absolutely on target.</p>
        <p>I'm particularly dismayed to see the presidential contenders Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John McCain parroting the crazy Bush line that ''we have to fight them there to keep them from coming to kill us here.'' In fact, by stoking anti-American hostility and boosting recruitment for jihadist fanatics, our Mesopotamian adventure has not reduced the terrorist threat but enhanced it.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, now that we're there, it's a poor choice; there's no exit strategy that doesn't raise the possibility of making things even worse for the Iraqis and our interests in the Middle East. But some kind of phased extrication is a less dangerous option than staying a disastrous course.</p>
        <p>Andy Anderson  Bronxville, N.Y., May 28, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Krugman has learned all the wrong lessons from 9/11 and Iraq. He thinks that going after Al Qaeda and its leadership is the way to win the war against terror.</p>
        <p>Yet for every Qaeda terrorist we kill, a hundred are poised to replace him. Only by conducting regime change among countries that support terrorism can we ever hope to destroy terrorism.</p>
        <p>Think about it: what would make you feel safer -- Osama bin Laden and a hundred of his lieutenants dead, or a democratic Iraq?</p>
        <p>Ari Weitzner  New York, May 28, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Krugman writes, ''Future historians will shake their heads over how easily America was misled into war.'' I am sorry, but I do not think that future historians will be puzzled at all.</p>
        <p>They will have already learned about a populace blissfully ignorant of anything going on outside their immediate sphere of life. They will have noticed what journalists compromised for access. They will have watched tapes of the Anna Nicole Smith saga play out for weeks as headline news. They will have stared in disbelief at the kind of clowning that passes for political discussion.</p>
        <p>No, Mr. Krugman, the Iraq war is just what they will have expected, and they will teach it in their schools as an example of the danger of having a disengaged populace in the world's dominant military power.</p>
