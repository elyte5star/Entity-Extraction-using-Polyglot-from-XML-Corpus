        <p>THE government said economic growth was slower in the first quarter than it had initially estimated. Chinese markets swooned, but American investors reached new heights. The World Bank has big money-raising needs for its new leader.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust investigation of Google's planned $3.1 billion purchase of the online advertising company DoubleClick.</p>
        <p>Rivals of Google contend that the merger would give Google immense power in Internet advertising in both search ads and display ads online. Privacy groups worry that Google will add its search histories to DoubleClick's data on users' Web-viewing habits, posing a new threat to privacy online.</p>
        <p>Google replied that the online advertising market is young and dynamic, and it expressed confidence that the deal would be approved. The company said it was sensitive to privacy concerns.</p>
        <p>No matter the outcome in the United States, Google's ambitious plans may face a stiffer challenge in Europe, where regulators take a harder line on privacy matters than in the United States and a tougher stance on antitrust issues (as Microsoft has learned)</p>
