        <p>The City Council is poised to introduce one of the most sweeping campaign finance overhauls in the country, aimed at limiting the influence of contractors, lobbyists, developers and others who do business with the city.</p>
        <p>The bill, which the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, plans to introduce as early as Tuesday, would sharply reduce the contribution limits of a broad swath of people, including those seeking land-use decisions and zoning variances, according to several people familiar with the legislation.</p>
        <p>Under the leading proposal being discussed, contribution limits for people with city business would be reduced to $250 from the $2,750 currently allowed in City Council races; to $320 from $3,850 in borough president races; and to $400 from $4,950 in mayoral and other citywide races.</p>
        <p>Those numbers as well as other details of the proposal were subject to change as negotiations went into the weekend. But the overall effect of the bill would be to drastically reduce the amount of contributions by people seeking favors from government policy and decision makers.</p>
        <p>A 2006 study by the Campaign Finance Board, the agency that oversees city election finances, found that individuals or companies with city business dealings accounted for 27.5 percent of all donations in the 2001 election cycle, about $15.6 million of $56.8 million donated. The total slightly dropped to 22.3 percent in the 2005 election cycle.</p>
        <p>That accounted only for contractors and lobbyists, because data on developers and other people who would fall under the new bill was not available at the time, according to board officials.</p>
        <p>The bill comes on top of lobbying restrictions the Council passed last year, which barred campaign contributions from lobbyists and their family members from receiving public matching funds.</p>
        <p>The current bill would expand the public matching restriction to all those defined as ''doing business'' with the city, cutting off a significant source of revenue to city campaigns.</p>
        <p>Under current regulations, for example, any contribution to a Council candidate from a city resident is automatically matched $4 for every $1 up to the first $250 of the contribution. So a $1,000 contribution generates an additional $1,000 in public matching funds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn and her staff declined to discuss the bill yesterday, as did administration officials and other people involved in the negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Council has been working closely with the Bloomberg administration and the Campaign Finance Board for the past six months to hammer out a bill.</p>
        <p>Several council members have said the changes could make it difficult to raise enough money to mount a campaign. Some also worry that the reforms could place onerous demands on candidates to ensure that contributors with city dealings do not exceed donation limits.</p>
        <p>Government watchdog groups who have followed the negotiations praised the Council's efforts to curb so-called pay-to-play contributions. But some warned that the new restrictions could lead lobbyists and others to expand their use of bundling, the process of seeking, collecting and delivering contributions on behalf of others to candidates.</p>
        <p>''Restricting pay-to-play contributions will vastly improve the program by taking a lot of big money out of the system and increasing the value of smaller gifts,'' said Dick Dadey, executive director of the Citizens Union.</p>
        <p>''But it could also strengthen the power of those who raise and collect money for candidates, which is why greater disclosure of bundled gifts will be necessary.''</p>
        <p>Among the measures being discussed would be a requirement to expand campaign disclosure rules to include bundlers who solicit donations but do not directly deliver them to the campaign. Currently, candidates must identify only those bundlers who collect and deliver contributions. This is another measure that concerns some council members, who say it would be difficult to identify people who only solicit donations.</p>
        <p>As word of the legislation has filtered out, some lobbyists and others are questioning whether the proposed restrictions are tantamount to discrimination.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen the legislation, but participating in the electoral process is one of the most important fundamental rights given to us by the Constitution,'' said Sid Davidoff, senior partner of Davidoff &amp; Malito, one of the state's biggest lobbying firms.</p>
        <p>''I can assure you, lawyers will be looking at this.''</p>
