        <p>For the first time since his abduction, a British reporter kidnapped in Gaza on March 12 was shown Friday in a video released to an Islamic militant Web site. Later on Friday, Israeli troops killed two young Palestinians and wounded a third near the Gaza border with Israel.</p>
        <p>The three Palestinians, ages 12, 13 and 16, were crouched near the border fence close to the demolished Israeli settlement of Dugit, said an army spokeswoman, Maj. Avital Leibovich. The three ''were walking in operational mode close to the fence, where we have alerts about infiltration,'' she said. ''We identified them as youth, not as children.''</p>
        <p>The three ignored warnings and were shot.</p>
        <p>The two youngest, Ahmed Abu Zubeida, 12, and Zaher al-Majdalawi, 13, were killed, Palestinian medical workers said. The third was wounded and taken to an Israeli hospital. The army said the boys had been planting what appeared to be an explosive device and might have been paid by elders to do so. Local Palestinians said that they had been searching for scrap metal.</p>
        <p>The video of the abducted journalist, Alan Johnston, 45, the Gaza correspondent for the BBC, was undated. But it was the first sign that he was alive after his kidnapping at gunpoint in Gaza City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston, wearing a red sweatshirt, appeared thinner but healthy, his normally cleanshaven head showing longer hair above his ears. That was the best indication that the video was relatively recent.</p>
        <p>His captors, a shadowy group called the Army of Islam, demanded that Britain release a jailed Islamic militant, Omar Mahmoud Othman, known as Abu Qutada, who has been accused of being a key leader of Al Qaeda in Europe.</p>
        <p>In the videotape, Mr. Johnston, normally very calm, appears to be under stress and speaking from a script, and the audio has jumps and breaks. He says he has been treated well and fed regularly. ''There has been no violence toward me at all, and I'm in good health,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He expressed sympathy with ''the huge suffering of the Palestinian people, and my message is that their suffering is continuing and that it is unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>In the video, Mr. Johnston utters crudely expressed opinions denouncing Israeli, British and American policies in the Middle East. He says things that he is unlikely to believe and would not allow himself to broadcast in ordinary circumstances.</p>
        <p>In one portion, for instance, he says: ''You see on your television screens ordinary people [inaudible] suffering as the armies of America and [inaudible] America attack [inaudible] attack.</p>
        <p>''In all this, we can see the British government endlessly working to occupy, er, the Muslim lands, against the will of the people in those places. From history, the British worked to bring about the state of Israel, which is the cause of all the suffering of the Israeli -- of the Palestinian people, and we, the British, are completely to blame, along with the Americans, for the situation in Iraq, and the British are the main force in Afghanistan, causing all the trouble to ordinary, simple Afghans who simply want to live.''</p>
        <p>The British government said it was investigating the videotape but denounced its release as a cruelty to Mr. Johnston's family.</p>
        <p>In a statement, his family said that they were ''very pleased to see Alan and to hear him say that he is not being ill treated, although it is clearly distressing for us to see him in these circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston was concluding a three-year assignment in the Gaza Strip. He re-entered the territory on March 12 and was driven to his office in Gaza City, where he picked up his rental car to drive to his apartment. He was alone. He was taken from the car at gunpoint and managed to drop a business card on the pavement.</p>
        <p>He is the longest-held Westerner in Gaza, and rallies calling for his release by his colleagues in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, as well as London, have not been successful.</p>
        <p>Many Palestinians say Mr. Johnston may have been kidnapped by the Dagmoush clan, which is also believed to have kidnapped two Fox News correspondents last summer. Both kidnappings have had Islamic militant overtones, but Palestinian Authority officials have said the kidnappings are fundamentally criminal and financial in nature.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Fox journalists, the distribution of a video in which they made statements they later retracted was followed by their release, as if the video was a part of an agreement with the kidnappers. Fox News denied paying a ransom. Diplomats say Britain is not negotiating with Mr. Johnston's kidnappers.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Ghazi Hamad, spokesman for the Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, said in Wales that ''I know that he is well and healthy,'' and that ''no one has tried to harm him or hurt him.'' But the kidnappers have ignored pleas from Mr. Haniya and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamad said he had received news of Mr. Johnston two days before. ''There are continuous efforts to release him,'' he said. ''We hope we can do it very, very soon.''</p>
        <p>Separately, officials from Israel's main labor federation, the Histadrut, reacted angrily to a proposal before the main British public employees' union, known as Unison, that it consider a boycott of Israel because of Israel's policies in the Palestinian territories.</p>
        <p>The leader of the Histadrut, Ofer Eini, wrote his Unison counterpart that ''despite the aggression of the Palestinians, it never occurred to me to impose a boycott on Palestinian workers or employees.''</p>
