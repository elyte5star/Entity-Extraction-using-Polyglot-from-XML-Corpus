        <p>The number of unidentified corpses discovered in Baghdad soared more than 70 percent during May, according to new statistics from the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, an indication that sectarian killings are rising sharply as militias return to the streets after lying low during the first few months of the troop ''surge.''</p>
        <p>In May, 726 unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad, many bound and shot in the head or showing signs of torture and execution, compared with 411 during April, according to figures provided by a ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration and military have cited a decline in sectarian killings as proof that the troop escalation is working. And despite May's increase in corpses, the numbers remain far below the peak of sectarian executions last year. In July and August, for example, a total of 5,106 people died violent deaths in Baghdad alone, according to the United Nations, including 3,391 reported by the city's morgue.</p>
        <p>The new figures also show a decline in the number of deaths of identifiable victims in Baghdad to 344 in May from 495 in April. While victims of car bombs, homemade bombs and mortar strikes can usually be identified, those who are kidnapped, tortured and executed are normally stripped of identification before their bodies are dumped.</p>
        <p>Three more American soldiers were reported killed: two in Baghdad on Wednesday, one from a roadside bomb and one from small-arms fire, and one Friday by small-arms fire near Zawiyah.</p>
        <p>Three children, ages 7, 9 and 11, were killed when a allied tank attacked insurgents trying to bury a bomb near Falluja on Friday, the military said. The insurgents escaped.</p>
        <p>The increase in sectarian killings came as residents reported more than a dozen people killed this week in the insurgent-dominated Amiriya district of western Baghdad in what they described as fierce skirmishes between Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and the Islamic Army of Iraq. The fighting appeared to be the first large-scale battles inside Baghdad between Al Qaeda and other Sunni insurgent groups.</p>
        <p>Terrified Amiriya residents said by telephone on Friday that they were holed up in their homes after Iraqi and American forces warned them to stay inside. American officials said they also imposed a ban on vehicles in the district. Some residents said the forces appeared to be allowing the Sunni insurgent groups to fight Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>The American battalion commander responsible for operations in the area, Lt. Col. Dale Kuehl, said, ''We have been involved in operations with the Iraqi Army and local nationals against Al Qaeda in Amiriya,'' according to a statement. ''I believe today was relatively quiet as Al Qaeda is regrouping,'' he said.</p>
        <p>According to residents interviewed, it was unclear how much of the fighting was driven by objections to Al Qaeda's extremist tactics and attacks on other Sunnis, or reflected a turf battle in Amiriya, a large district near Abu Ghraib, by two insurgent factions that not long ago were allies.</p>
        <p>Several residents said the fighting began after Qaeda members went to a mosque and confronted and later killed a leader in the Islamic Army, an insurgent group with ties to mainstream Sunni parties. The Islamic Army retaliated by killing several Qaeda fighters, spurring all-out fighting, residents said.</p>
        <p>''What is happening now is to clear the name of the Iraqi resistance from all the crimes committed by Al Qaeda against the Sunnis,'' one Amiriya resident said, adding that at least 40 people were killed.</p>
        <p>One midlevel commander in the Islamic Army said he lost two men during the fighting but that the ''operation will last forever until we get rid of Al Qaeda.'' Some residents said another Iraqi insurgent group, the 20th Revolutionary Brigades, joined the fighting against Al Qaeda. But that group later issued a statement denying it had taken part.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, 10 people were killed and 30 wounded during a mortar strike in western Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official. Fifteen bodies were also discovered in the city. The killing and dumping of corpses is a hallmark of Shiite militiamen, notably the Mahdi Army, the force that sprang from the movement of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.</p>
        <p>American military commanders in Baghdad have said they believe some Mahdi Army commanders who fled Baghdad in January and February have returned recently. Officials close to Mr. Sadr have asserted that many militiamen who identify themselves as Mahdi fighters are operating outside of Mr. Sadr's command.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Agence France-Presse reported that Iraqi civilian deaths soared by almost a third in May, after a decline in April. The Iraqi government has lately refused to release official data on civilian casualties. But the report said information from the Interior, Health and Defense Ministries found at least 1,951 civilians killed throughout the country in May, a 30 percent increase from April. In the past month, American military officials in Baghdad have acknowledged an uptick in sectarian killings. But on Friday a spokesman did not respond to questions about increased civilian deaths in May.</p>
        <p>South of the capital, military officials said tests concluded that a body recovered from the Euphrates River on May 27 was not one of two American soldiers still missing since their abduction May 12 near Mahmudiya.</p>
        <p>Also on Friday, state-run television reported that Abdul Aziz al-Hakim had returned from Iran, where he sought treatment for a tumor. Mr. Hakim, leader of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, one of the two most powerful Shiite parties, earlier said he traveled to the United States and Iran for treatment of ''limited infections'' and a ''limited tumor.''</p>
