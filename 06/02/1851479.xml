        <p>Jack Kevorkian, the former pathologist who brought the debate over physician-assisted suicide into the national spotlight a decade ago, saying he had helped 130 terminally ill people in their deaths, stepped out of a Michigan prison on Friday having pledged not to assist anyone else.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kevorkian, 79, looked slightly frailer than he had when he was sent to prison eight years ago, convicted of second-degree murder in one death. One in a long list of conditions Mr. Kevorkian agreed to as part of a two-year period of parole, Michigan prison officials said, was not to participate in future suicides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kevorkian said little to reporters as he was whisked away from a medium-security prison meant for the elderly in Coldwater, Mich., but his release set off a flood of reaction from those around the country focused on questions of assisted suicide, euthanasia and dying.</p>
        <p>Supporters of assisted suicide noted Mr. Kevorkian as a bold advocate for his beliefs and for the gravely ill, but some also sought on Friday to draw distance between him and their current political efforts.</p>
        <p>''He did a lot for the national dialogue way back when, but he also got carried away,'' said Lloyd E. Levine, a Democratic assemblyman in California who is sponsoring a bill -- due for a vote next week -- that would allow some terminally ill patients there to legally seek lethal drugs under a set of guidelines.</p>
        <p>''Actually,'' Mr. Levine said, ''he is the perfect reason we need this law in California. We don't want there to be more Dr. Kevorkians.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kevorkian's critics and opponents of assisted suicide, meanwhile, expressed concern about whether he would keep his promise, and pointed to him and his defiant methods in the 1990s as sinister symbols.</p>
        <p>''It's important to remember that this man was on a ghoulish death crusade,'' said Ed Rivet, the legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan. ''He was dumping bodies all over the place. This guy is a twisted individual, and it's important to us that he not be given credibility.''</p>
        <p>In the years Mr. Kevorkian spent in prison, little has changed legally in this realm across the country. Oregon remains the only state with a law in which a terminally ill patient can ask a doctor to prescribe a lethal amount of medication under certain circumstances. Since 1998, 292 people have died under the terms of Oregon's Death With Dignity Act.</p>
        <p>Other states, including Vermont, have rejected such proposals, and national advocates for assisted suicide said they would be watching California's bill next week with particular concern.</p>
        <p>''If it doesn't pass there, that will be a pretty good sign to us that no legislative body will pass it,'' said Barbara Lee, the president of Compassion &amp; Choices, a group based in Denver and Portland that supports assisted suicide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kevorkian was tried four times in the deaths of ill people before being convicted in 1999 of giving a fatal injection to Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man who had Lou Gehrig's disease. He was sentenced to 10 to 25 years. The main evidence against him was a tape showing the injection that Mr. Kevorkian had taken to ''60 Minutes,'' the CBS News program that broadcast it at the time along with an interview in which Mr. Kevorkian challenged the law enforcement authorities to try him.</p>
        <p>Outside the prison on Friday, Mr. Kevorkian briefly embraced Mike Wallace, the ''60 Minutes'' correspondent who taped a new interview with him on Friday. It is to be broadcast on Sunday evening. Mr. Kevorkian, the same gaunt, white-haired figure familiar to many, smiled and quietly told reporters that leaving prison was ''one of the high points of life.'' His lawyers have said he is ill, suffering from hepatitis C. He will live with friends in Michigan.</p>
        <p>Russ Marlan, a spokesman for the state's Department of Corrections, said the conditions of Mr. Kevorkian's parole did not preclude his speaking broadly in support of the notion of assisted suicide, but barred him from helping anyone directly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kevorkian's friends welcomed his return, calling him a caring leader who had aided the wishes of the terminally ill and who, in return, had been grossly abused by the legal system. They had little patience with national advocates now distancing themselves from Mr. Kevorkian.</p>
        <p>''These people have done nothing regarding the issue, and Jack has,'' Geoffrey Fieger, Mr. Kevorkian's former lawyer, said in a telephone interview. ''If we depended on them to get anything done, nothing would get done.''</p>
        <p>In Michigan, efforts to legalize assisted suicide have faded in the years since Mr. Kevorkian made headlines, said Shaw Livermore Jr., once president of the Hemlock Society of Michigan, who said the group was now largely ''moribund.''</p>
        <p>In part, Mr. Livermore said, it was the effect of so many failed efforts for laws in various states. But there were other factors, too, he said.</p>
        <p>''To some, Dr. Kevorkian was a hero,'' Mr. Livermore said. ''To others, he is one of the reasons we didn't succeed. Rather than waiting for it to be legal, he went and did it, and that seemed to energize the opponents.''</p>
