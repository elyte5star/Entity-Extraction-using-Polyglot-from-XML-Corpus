        <p>The life-size plastic cows remain frozen in rumination at the old farm fence as weekend drivers wend along the country road.

Well, yes, in a certain existential way, we have indeed arrived in the country on our weekend trek from the city.

        <p>The life-size plastic cows remain frozen in rumination at the old farm fence as weekend drivers wend along the country road. After a double-take, a driver ponders the brindled statues as an answer to the timeless question: Are we there yet? Well, yes, in a certain existential way, we have indeed arrived in the country on our weekend trek from the city. Except -- not to get too urban kvetchy about this -- the country isn't what it used to be. Those fake cows stand where actual ones used to graze on the North Fork pastures of eastern Long Island.</p>
        <p>Best to be grateful for four-legged tokens of rural camp. The country-scape plays myriad tricks these days as old farms become vineyards for tax write-offs, or grow perfect carpets of emerald sod cut for country McMansion lawns filling the rustic blanks.</p>
        <p>The multiplying tasting rooms of the vineyards are as much fun to witness as petting zoos, all that swirling and sniffing and pursed-lip pronouncing. Staring beyond one faux-country watering hole, a visitor can recall a nonvirtual farm scene witnessed four decades ago. Freshman Assemblyman Charles Rangel journeyed out from Harlem to kick doors open and shame local farmers for exploiting harvest stoop laborers bussed up from the Deep South. They were housed in shotgun shacks where new developments now blossom with geysers of pastel water worthy of Florida retirement.</p>
        <p>Blurring past the vineyards, where the rare tractor lumbers by, go the endless to-and-fro of gamblers to the ferry for the Indian casino in Connecticut. The effervescent hope of wannabe winners, eastbound, and the road rage of returning losers, westbound, can take a heavy toll in road kill. (Will plastic road kill someday have to be invented to help us imagine Country?)</p>
        <p>Weekenders still enjoy real-life fauna like the mellow gangs of city motorcyclists trailing gray ponytails and the osprey fish hawks pampered in tower nests customized by preservationists. Other weekenders bedeviled by deer using showcase gardens as salad bars cheer the rulers in one town who ordered an extended, secretive deer culling. It left a breathtaking 500 slain, versus 14 the previous year.</p>
        <p>Thus stir the new ways of country life. Still, drivers stuck in Sunday night traffic back to the city are free to fantasize the evolution of Super Deer to rival Super Rat of urban myth, a creature to prevail against all human conceits of pesticide.</p>
