        <p>Dutch TV Hoax Revealed</p>
        <p>The ''Big Donor Show,'' a controversial Dutch reality series on which a terminally ill woman, identified only as Lisa, 37, was to hear interviews with three candidates, their families and friends before deciding who would receive one of her kidneys, turns out to have been a hoax. Lisa was revealed to be a healthy actress, and the organ candidates, too, were plants, Reuters reported yesterday. The revelations came just before the show was to be broadcast on the BNN network yesterday. BNN said it had wanted to draw attention to the shortage of organ donors in the Netherlands; others suggested that the hoax was just a ratings ploy.</p>
        <p>Police Misconduct</p>
        <p>The singer in the Police jumps like a ''petulant pansy,'' the drummer is making a ''complete hash,'' and who knows what the guitarist is doing? So says the drummer himself as the reunited trio tries to recapture its form, Reuters reported yesterday. The frank remarks by Stewart Copeland, the drummer, came in a posting on stewartcopeland.net on Thursday, a day after the band played its second show before 20,000 fans in Vancouver, British Columbia. ''This is unbelievably lame,'' wrote Mr. Copeland, above. ''We are the mighty Police and we are totally at sea.'' Mr. Copeland noted that he tripped as he took to the stage, then banged his gong at the wrong time so that ''the big pompous opening to the show is a damp squib.'' He did not hear the guitarist Andy Summers's opening riff to ''Message in a Bottle,'' and Sting in turn misheard Mr. Copeland's drum intro -- ''so we are half a bar out of sync with each other,'' he wrote. ''Andy is in Idaho.'' Later Sting got his footwork wrong as he leapt into the air to signal the end to ''Synchronicity II.'' ''The mighty Sting momentarily looks like a petulant pansy instead of the god of rock,'' Mr. Copeland reported. Afterward, the three fell into one another's arms, laughing, Mr. Copeland wrote, adding, ''It's only music.'' The band's next show is today in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
        <p>Deceptive Doo-Wop</p>
        <p>On Thursday Nevada became one of about a dozen states to enact laws against groups falsely promoting themselves as famous musicians, The Associated Press reported. The new law requires performing groups to include at least one member of the group that they claim a connection to, or to label the production a ''tribute'' or ''salute.'' Otherwise, claiming a connection would be considered a deceptive trade practice. Sonny Turner, right, of the Platters, Jon (Bowzer) Bauman of Sha Na Na, Mary Wilson of the Supremes and others urged the Nevada legislature to pass the bill. Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Illinois are among the states with similar legislation.</p>
        <p>Accusations in Italy</p>
        <p>Testifying in the trial of an American dealer and a former J. Paul Getty Museum curator in Rome, an Italian archaeologist, Daniela Rizzo, said that she had traced dozens of artifacts in top-rate collections -- including those of the Getty and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York -- to Giacomo Medici, an Italian convicted in 2004 of dealing in illicitly excavated antiquities. (He is appealing his conviction.) ''I have no doubt whatsoever that these objects come from clandestine digs,'' Ms. Rizzo told the court. Defense lawyers countered that Ms. Rizzo's claims were hypothetical. The American antiquities dealer Robert Hecht and Marion True, the former Getty curator, are charged with conspiring to acquire archaeological treasures looted from Italy. Ms. Rizzo said that other American collectors to whom Mr. Medici sold looted artifacts included Shelby White, a Met trustee; the diamond magnate Maurice Tempelsman; and Barbara Fleischman, a former Getty trustee. Italy has not charged any of them with wrongdoing, but it is negotiating with Ms. White for the return of some pieces.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>The Beastie Boys will be honored as artists of the year at the 11th annual Webby Awards, which recognize online and wireless work, on Tuesday in New York City. The soprano Nelly Miricioiu will make her New York City Opera debut this fall in the title role in Handel's ''Agrippina,'' replacing Ruth Ann Swenson, who is recovering from breast cancer. The West End production of ''Mary Poppins'' will close at the Prince Edward Theater on Jan. 12 after a run of three and a half years, Cameron Mackintosh and Disney, the show's producers, announced. The theater will become home to ''Jersey Boys.''</p>
