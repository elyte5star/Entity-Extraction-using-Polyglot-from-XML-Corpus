        <p>An article on Wednesday about the impact that a Senate proposal to overhaul immigration law could have on New York misstated a provision of the bill. Immigrants who are relatives of United States citizens and have overstayed their temporary visas could indeed qualify for legalization on the same terms as illegal immigrants who crossed the border surreptitiously. Also, the article referred incompletely to another provision of the bill. While it would eliminate the right of citizens to sponsor their parents -- a right that is now unlimited -- it would create an annual quota of 40,000 visas for which citizens could compete to bring parents into the country.</p>
