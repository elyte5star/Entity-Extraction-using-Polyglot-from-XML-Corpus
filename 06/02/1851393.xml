        <p>8 P.M. (Hallmark Channel) MARCO POLO -- (2007) Ian Somerhalder (''Lost''), left, plays that 13th-century rambling man who barely survived a trek from Venice to the far side of the world, where he spent 20 years in the court of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan (Brian Dennehy) and discovered mysteries like timepieces, paper currency, a postal system, pasta and ice cream. B. D. Wong plays Polo's peripatetic servant and friend, Pedro. Desiree Siahann does double duty as both objects of Polo's affection, the courtesan Temulun and her younger sister, Kensai.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (BBC America) HEX -- At the end of last season, the aborted fetus of one of the supernaturally powered teenagers enrolled in this series's spooky British boarding school was found alive and growing at an inhuman rate. In this three-hour season premiere, his birth is discovered to have unleashed a battery of fallen angels who are out to kill the human race. And only Ella (Laura Pyper), who is all doped up in a psychiatric hospital, can save it.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (21) BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH THE SESSIONS BAND LIVE IN DUBLIN -- In this special, filmed in November at the Point in Dublin, the Boss performs works from ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,'' his album of songs by Pete Seeger.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Starz) THE DA VINCI CODE -- (2006) Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, who, after a murder at the Louvre, sets out to unravel a religious mystery that could rock the foundations of Christianity in this adaptation of the Dan Brown best seller. Audrey Tautou, above with Mr. Hanks, is Sophie Neveu, his police agent sidekick whose own connection to the crime isn't just business -- it's personal. And Ian McKellen is Sir Leigh Teabing, a British researcher with a vested interest in what Langdon and his colleague uncover.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (National Geographic Channel) DANGEROUS ENCOUNTERS: BITE FORCE 2 -- Brady Barr -- who has wrestled a giant python, ridden in a truckload of cobras and been bitten by an Indian gharial (a type of crocodile) -- goes in search of something whose snap is even more fierce: a wild Nile crocodile in Tanzania. If Mr. Barr can manage to force his bite meter into its mouth, he may beat his previous world record.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (TLC) BACKYARD NATION -- It's no longer about a patch of green and a rusty grill. These days backyard living is more about getting the biggest bang for the buck, from a grassy knoll fit for a Greek god to a fantasy world right out of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' This new series revs up with a motocross veteran who wants to give his two dirt-bike-racing boys an extreme playground.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BBCA) THE GRAHAM NORTON SHOW -- The razor-tongued Mr. Norton is back with a new show centered on a fascinating mix -- at least to him -- of people, trends and celebrity culture. Tonight's guests of honor: Kim Cattrall, left, and Elijah Wood.</p>
