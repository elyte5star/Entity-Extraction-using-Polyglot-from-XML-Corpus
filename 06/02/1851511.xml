        <p>While losing to the Yankees, 9-5, on Friday night, the Red Sox also lost two starters to injuries, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>Third baseman Mike Lowell, hit by a 93-mile-an-hour fastball from Chien-Ming Wang in the third inning, left in the top of the fifth with a bruised left hand.

        <p>While losing to the Yankees, 9-5, on Friday night, the Red Sox also lost two starters to injuries, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>Third baseman Mike Lowell, hit by a 93-mile-an-hour fastball from Chien-Ming Wang in the third inning, left in the top of the fifth with a bruised left hand. X-rays did not show a break, the Red Sox announced. Right fielder J. D. Drew left in the top of the sixth with a strained right hamstring.</p>
        <p>Lowell is batting .328 with 10 home runs and 41 runs batted in. Drew is hitting .222 with 2 home runs and 17 R.B.I., although Manager Terry Francona expressed optimism before the game that Drew's slump would soon end.</p>
        <p>''He's going to be O.K.,'' Francona said. ''He's too good a hitter. Sometimes you have to be patient and tell him you believe in him -- which we do.''</p>
        <p>Over all, it was not an impressive performance for the Red Sox, who began the night with a 10-game lead in the American League East over second-place Baltimore. They were 13 1/2 games ahead of the Yankees, who were tied for fourth with Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>(The Devil Rays lost Friday to Kansas City.)</p>
        <p>Tim Wakefield, the starting pitcher, struggled mightily for Boston. He left after three and two-thirds innings after giving up eight runs and five hits. Wakefield (5-6) is a knuckleball pitcher. He walked five batters, hit one, threw one wild pitch and catcher Doug Mirabelli had one passed ball.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored one run on the wild pitch and one run on the passed ball. Wakefield threw 81 pitches, only 38 of them strikes.</p>
        <p>Until Friday night, the most serious injury this season for the Red Sox was to starter Josh Beckett, who sustained a torn flap of skin on his right middle finger in May and spent 15 days on the disabled list. Beckett has since returned and raised his record to 8-0 with a 4-2 victory against Cleveland on Tuesday.</p>
